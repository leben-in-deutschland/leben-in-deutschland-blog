💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After World War II, Germany was divided into East and West, with the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) established in 1949. During the Cold War, the country’s borders were influenced by alliances and geopolitical changes. In the following decades, efforts such as Ostpolitik aimed to improve relations with Eastern neighbors. The significant transformation occurred in 1990, when the Berlin Wall fell, leading to the reunification of Germany. This reunification solidified the current boundaries of the Federal Republic, aligning them with historical borders recognized today.
