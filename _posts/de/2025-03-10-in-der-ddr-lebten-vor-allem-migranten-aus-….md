  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    During the existence of the German Democratic Republic (DDR), East Germany established strong ties with socialist and allied nations. As part of its international solidarity and economic agreements, the DDR welcomed migrants primarily from countries aligned with the Eastern Bloc. Notably, workers and refugees arrived from Vietnam, Poland, and Mozambique, reflecting political alliances and support for liberation movements. These migrations were facilitated through bilateral agreements aimed at fostering mutual economic benefits and ideological cooperation. Understanding these demographic patterns highlights the DDR’s role in the broader context of Cold War geopolitics and its commitment to supporting allied nations.
