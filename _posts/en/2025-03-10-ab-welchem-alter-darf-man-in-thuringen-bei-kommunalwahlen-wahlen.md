    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, voting ages vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. Thuringia has specific regulations for local elections that affect local political decisions, such as the election of city councils or municipal councils. In recent years, there have been discussions about lowering the voting age in order to involve younger citizens more in political processes. These changes aim to promote the political participation of young people and give them a voice in their immediate environment.
