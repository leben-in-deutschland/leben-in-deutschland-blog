  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Saxony-Anhalt is a federal state in Germany with a state government that includes various ministries. Typical positions are Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of the Interior. However, foreign affairs fall within the competence of the federal government, which is why Saxony-Anhalt does not have a foreign minister. This structure reflects the federal organization of Germany, in which certain tasks are regulated at the state level and others at the federal level.
