💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, voting ages vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. While the general suffrage for Bundestag elections usually applies from the age of 18, some federal states, including Saxony, have lowered the voting age for local elections. Local elections affect local administrations such as cities and municipalities. This adaptation aims to involve younger citizens more closely in political decision-making processes and to promote their participation at the local level. In Saxony, young people from a certain age are therefore allowed to participate in these elections.
