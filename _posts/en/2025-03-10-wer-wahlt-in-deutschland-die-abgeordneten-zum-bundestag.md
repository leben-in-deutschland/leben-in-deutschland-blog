    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the democratic election of members of the Bundestag is based on the principle of universal, free and equal suffrage. All citizens entitled to vote who have reached the age of 18 and live in Germany can participate in the Bundestag elections. They vote for parties and direct candidates in their constituencies. The military, business or administration have no direct say in the election of deputies. This structure ensures the representation of the people in the national parliament.
