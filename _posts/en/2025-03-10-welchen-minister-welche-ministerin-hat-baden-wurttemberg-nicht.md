  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Baden-Württemberg is one of the 16 federal states in Germany and has several state ministries that take on various administrative tasks. Typical ministries include Finance, Justice and Home Affairs, which are responsible for regional administration and legislation. However, foreign policy is not one of the competences of the state government, as this task is taken over by the federal government at the federal level. Therefore, there is no foreign minister in Baden-Württemberg.
