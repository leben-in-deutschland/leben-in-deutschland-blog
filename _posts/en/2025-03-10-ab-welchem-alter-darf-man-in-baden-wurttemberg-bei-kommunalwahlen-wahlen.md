💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, voting ages vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. Baden-Württemberg is a federal state that determines local decisions through local elections, such as the election of city councillors or municipal councillors. The determination of the minimum age for the right to vote in these elections may deviate from the general regulations at federal level. While the general voting age for Bundestag and state elections is usually 18 years, some federal states allow younger citizens to cast their votes at a lower age in local elections. This is intended to promote the political participation of young people.
