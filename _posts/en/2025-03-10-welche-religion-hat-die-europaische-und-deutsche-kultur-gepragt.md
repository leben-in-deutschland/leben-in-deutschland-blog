  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    European and German culture has been strongly influenced by religious influences for centuries. Christianity, in particular, played a central role in the development of art, architecture, legal systems, and social values. Churches built impressive cathedrals, religious holidays shaped the calendar, and Christian ethics influenced social interaction. Education and science were also often promoted by church institutions. Other religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism or Islam also had influence, but to a lesser extent compared to Christianity, which established the dominant form of culture in Europe and Germany.
