    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the Federal Republic of Germany, outstanding achievements in politics, business, culture, science or social affairs are honoured with official awards. The best-known honour is the **Federal Cross of Merit**, which is awarded by the Federal Government. Symbols such as the **Federal Eagle** represent the state, while the **Fatherland Order of Merit** was an award of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Titles such as "Hero of the German Democratic Republic" are specific to the former East German state system. These distinctions help to understand which award is currently valid in Germany.
