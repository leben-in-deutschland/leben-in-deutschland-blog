  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, which were controlled by the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This division led to the founding of two separate German states: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The GDR originated in the Soviet occupation zone and developed into a socialist state under strong influence from the Soviet Union. Understanding this historical division is essential in order to grasp the political and social developments in Germany after the war.
