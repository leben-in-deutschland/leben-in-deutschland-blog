  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The founding of the State of Israel took place in the context of World War II and the Holocaust, which strengthened international awareness of the need for a Jewish homeland. In 1947, the United Nations passed Partition Resolution 181, which provided for the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. This resolution formed the legal basis for Israel's declaration of independence on May 14, 1948. International recognition by the UN played a crucial role in establishing Israel as a sovereign state.
