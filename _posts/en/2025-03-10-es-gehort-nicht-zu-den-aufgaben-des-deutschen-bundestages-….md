  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German Bundestag is the central legislative body in Germany. Its main tasks include drafting and passing laws, overseeing the federal government and electing the Federal Chancellor. In addition, the Bundestag monitors political work and ensures that the government acts in the interests of the citizens. However, the formation of the federal cabinet is not directly one of his tasks. This task is taken over by the elected Federal Chancellor himself or herself by selecting the ministers for the various departments.
