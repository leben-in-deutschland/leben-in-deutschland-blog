  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, voting ages vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. Brandenburg, as one of the 16 federal states, has specific regulations for local elections, which entitle citizens to participate in local politics. Local elections determine the composition of city and municipal councils, which make important decisions for the municipality. The right to vote is intended to ensure that young adults are involved in democratic processes at an early stage. Therefore, the minimum age for participation in these elections is set in Brandenburg.
