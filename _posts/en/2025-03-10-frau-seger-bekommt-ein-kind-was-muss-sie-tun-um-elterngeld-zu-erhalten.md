    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Parental allowance is financial support for parents in Germany who reduce or interrupt their employment after the birth of a child. It is intended to partially compensate for the loss of earnings and promote the compatibility of family and career. In order to receive parental allowance, parents must meet certain requirements and submit a formal application. The competent authority for processing the application is the parental allowance office. There is no automatic grant without an application.
