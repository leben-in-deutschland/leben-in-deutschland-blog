  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German Federal President is the head of state of Germany and mainly takes on representative tasks. In contrast to the federal government, which governs the country and drafts laws, the Federal President represents Germany internally and externally, receives foreign heads of state and signs laws. It ensures compliance with the constitution and can carry out important symbolic acts, but has no executive power.
