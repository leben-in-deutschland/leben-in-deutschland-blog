  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In German Bundestag elections, each voter has two votes: the first vote for a direct candidate and the second vote for a party. The second vote is decisive for the distribution of seats in parliament. In order to enter the Bundestag, parties must achieve a minimum percentage of second votes. This barrier clause is intended to prevent too many small parties from fragmenting the Bundestag. The exact percentage varies and is an important rule in the German electoral system.
