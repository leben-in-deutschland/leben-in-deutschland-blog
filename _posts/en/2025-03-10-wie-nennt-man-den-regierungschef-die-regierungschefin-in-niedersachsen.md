    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, each of the 16 federal states consists of its own state government. The head of government heads this government and represents the state externally. The designations for this position may vary depending on the state. In Lower Saxony, one of the largest federal states, the title of head of government is specifically defined. Knowledge of these titles is important for understanding the political structure and administrative management in the individual federal states.
