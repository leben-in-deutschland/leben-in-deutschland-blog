💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After World War II, Germany was divided into East and West, and Berlin was also divided along ideological lines. Between 1949 and 1961, West Berlin experienced a steady influx of citizens from the GDR fleeing to the West. In order to stop this flow of refugees and ensure the stability of the GDR, the East German authorities began building the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961. This wall symbolized the physical and ideological separation between the communist East and the capitalist West during the Cold War.
