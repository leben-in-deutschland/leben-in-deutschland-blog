    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The state parliament in Hamburg, the Hamburg Parliament, is the central legislative body of the city-state. It is elected to control the political decisions and administration of the Hanseatic city. Elections are held regularly to ensure that MPs represent the trust of citizens. The term of office of the members of parliament determines how long they remain in office before new elections are held. This system ensures continuous democratic control and adaptation of political leadership to the needs of the population.
