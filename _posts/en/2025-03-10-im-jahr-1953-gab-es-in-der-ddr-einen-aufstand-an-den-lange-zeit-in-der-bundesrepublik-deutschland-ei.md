    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In 1953, a major popular uprising took place in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Workers and citizens protested against poor working conditions, political repression and the coercive measures of the government. This uprising was brutally suppressed, but remained an important symbol of resistance against the communist regime. In what later became the Federal Republic of Germany, this historic event was commemorated for a long time by a holiday that preserved the memory of the courage and solidarity of the insurgents.
