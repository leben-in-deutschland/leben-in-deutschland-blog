  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. Shortly thereafter, the Nazis used political maneuvers, propaganda, and the elimination of opposition parties to consolidate their power. With the Enabling Act and other measures, they quickly transformed the Weimar Republic into totalitarian rule. These changes led to the establishment of a dictatorship in which the Nazi regime exercised unrestricted control over the state and society.
