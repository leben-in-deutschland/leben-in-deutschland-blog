  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the German Bundestag, the parliamentary opposition plays a central role in the political system. It consists of the parties that are not involved in the formation of the government and has the task of critically observing and controlling the government. The opposition makes inquiries, initiates debates and offers alternative political proposals. Through its oversight function, it contributes to the transparency and accountability of the government and ensures that different opinions are represented in parliament. This promotes a balanced power structure and strengthens democratic decision-making in the Bundestag.
