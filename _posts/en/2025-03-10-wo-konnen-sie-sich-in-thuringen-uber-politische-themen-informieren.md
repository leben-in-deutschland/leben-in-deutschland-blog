  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Thuringia, there are various contact points to find out about political topics. The **State Agency for Civic Education** offers comprehensive materials and events on civic education. In addition, local authorities such as the **Ordnungsamt** can provide insights into municipal regulations. Although churches are also socially engaged, they usually do not concentrate primarily on political education. The **Consumer Advice Centre** provides information primarily on consumer rights and protection, less on general political topics. This diversity enables citizens to use appropriate sources of information according to their interests and needs.
