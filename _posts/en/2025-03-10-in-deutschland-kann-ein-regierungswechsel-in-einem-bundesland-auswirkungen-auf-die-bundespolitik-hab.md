    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the political system consists of federal states and the federal government. Each federal state has its own government that influences the Bundesrat – the upper house of parliament. The Bundesrat consists of representatives of the state governments and participates in legislation. A change of government in a federal state can change the composition of the Bundesrat, which in turn can influence federal policy. Changes in the distribution of majorities in the Bundestag or Bundesrat can complicate or facilitate the legislative processes, depending on the parties involved and the financial resources of the federal state.
