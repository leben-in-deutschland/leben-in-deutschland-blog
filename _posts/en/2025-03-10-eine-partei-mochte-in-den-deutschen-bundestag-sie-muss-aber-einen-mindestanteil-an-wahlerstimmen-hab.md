  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, political parties are striving to enter the Bundestag, the national parliament. In order to keep the parliamentary structure stable and prevent fragmentation by many small parties, there is a minimum requirement for votes. This so-called five percent hurdle requires that a party must achieve at least five percent of the valid second votes nationwide. Only parties that overcome this hurdle receive seats in the Bundestag and can participate in legislation. This promotes larger, sustainable political forces in parliament.
