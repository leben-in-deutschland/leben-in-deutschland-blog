    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is a federal parliamentary republic in Central Europe, known for its democratic structures and rule of law. The country is based on fundamental rights and a constitution that guarantees the separation of powers. In addition, Germany assumes social responsibility through a comprehensive social system that promotes social justice. Historically, however, Germany has never been a monarchy since the end of the imperial era in 1918. These characteristics help to understand which forms of government Germany embodies and which do not.
