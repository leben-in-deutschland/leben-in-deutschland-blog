    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "Stasi" was the official secret service of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1950 to 1990. Their main task was to protect the government by gathering intelligence, monitoring opposition activities, and infiltrating potential opponents of the regime. The Stasi used an extensive network of informants and modern surveillance techniques to control the population and ensure political stability. It played a central role in the repressive state apparatus of the GDR and is an important symbol of state surveillance and human rights violations in German history.
