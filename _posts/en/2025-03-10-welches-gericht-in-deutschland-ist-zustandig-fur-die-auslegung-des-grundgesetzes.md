  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the judicial system consists of different levels of court, each with specific tasks. The Basic Law forms the constitution and lays down the basic rights and obligations. The interpretation and preservation of these constitutional provisions requires a special court with the competence to decide on constitutional questions. While local courts, administrative courts and higher regional courts are active in their respective areas of law, there is a special instance that is responsible for interpreting the Basic Law.
