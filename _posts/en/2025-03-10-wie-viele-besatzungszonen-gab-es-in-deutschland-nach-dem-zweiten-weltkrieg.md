    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the end of the Second World War in 1945, Germany was divided into occupation zones by the victorious powers. The main Allies – the United States, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union – each took control of different parts of the country. This division served the administration, demilitarization and demilitarization of Germany as well as preparation for possible reunification. A total of four occupation zones were created, which later became the basis for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.
