    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Federal Republic of Germany is divided by the Basic Law into various constitutional organs that assume central functions in the structure of the state. These bodies include the Bundesrat, the Federal President and the Federal Government. These institutions are essential for legislation, the implementation of laws and representative governance. In addition, there are other assemblies and committees, but not all of them have the status of constitutional bodies.
