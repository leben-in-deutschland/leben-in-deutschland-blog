  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the German Democratic Republic (DDR) officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990, leading to the reunification of East and West Germany. The former East German states, now new federal Länder, integrated into the existing political, economic, and international frameworks of unified Germany. This included becoming part of the European Union, which West Germany was already a member of. Reunification also meant leaving behind former alliances such as the Warsaw Pact, aligning the new states with Western institutions.
