    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    **Context:**  
Popular sovereignty is a central principle of democratic states, which states that all state power emanates from the people. This means that citizens have the highest power and legitimize the government and its decisions through elections and other democratic processes. In the German state system, this principle is anchored in the Basic Law and forms the basis for the democratic legitimacy of institutions such as the Bundestag.
