💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Schleswig-Holstein, there are various contact points where citizens can find out about political topics. The State Commissioners for Civic Education offer comprehensive information and educational opportunities on political processes and current developments. Consumer centres, on the other hand, concentrate on consumer protection and economic issues. Public order offices are responsible for public order and deal less with political education content. Churches are often involved in social debates, but not primarily in political education. It is therefore important to know which institution provides the appropriate information on political topics.
