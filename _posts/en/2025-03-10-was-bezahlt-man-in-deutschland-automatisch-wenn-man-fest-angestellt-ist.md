  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, permanent employees are automatically integrated into various social security systems. Contributions are regularly deducted from their salaries to finance these systems. These include health insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance and long-term care insurance. These automatic payments ensure that employees are covered in the event of illness, retirement or unemployment. In addition, there are other state benefits such as child benefit, but these are not deducted directly from the salary. Understanding these automatic payments is important for financial planning and social security in Germany.
