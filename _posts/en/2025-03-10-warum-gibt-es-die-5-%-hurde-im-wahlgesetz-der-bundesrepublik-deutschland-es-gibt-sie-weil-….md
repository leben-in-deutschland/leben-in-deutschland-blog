    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the Federal Republic of Germany, the electoral law sets the 5% hurdle, which states that a party must receive at least five percent of the second votes in order to enter the Bundestag. This regulation serves several purposes: it prevents a strong fragmentation of parliament by many small parties, facilitates the formation of stable government coalitions and ensures that only parties with broader support influence legislation. This is intended to make the political landscape clearer and more capable of acting.
