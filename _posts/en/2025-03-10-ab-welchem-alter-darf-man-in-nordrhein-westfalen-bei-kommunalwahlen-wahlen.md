  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, voting ages vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in particular, specific regulations apply to local elections that enable citizens to participate in local decision-making processes. While the general voting age for federal elections is 18, some federal states, including North Rhine-Westphalia, have opened up the right to vote for younger age groups in local elections. These adaptations are intended to promote the political participation of young people and give them the opportunity to influence their immediate environment at an early stage. Therefore, it is important to know from what age you can vote in local elections in NRW.
