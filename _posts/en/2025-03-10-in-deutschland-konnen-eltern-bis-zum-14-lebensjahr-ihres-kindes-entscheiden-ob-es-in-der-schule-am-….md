  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the school law regulates the rights of parents to have a say in the education of their children up to the age of 14. Parents can decide whether their children want to participate in certain types of lessons. This applies in particular to subjects that are optional or denominational in addition to the general curriculum. A typical example is religious education, where parents can choose whether their child participates. This arrangement allows families to take their religious beliefs into account in their children's educational process and to ensure that instruction is in line with family values.
