  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the right to vote varies depending on the type of election and the federal state. While the general voting age for federal elections and many state elections is 18, some federal states have lowered the voting age for local elections. Schleswig-Holstein is one of the federal states that allows younger citizens to participate in municipal decisions. This measure is intended to promote the political participation of young people and enable them to participate in earlier participation in their community. Thus, young people can actively participate in the democratic process at an earlier age.
