  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, freedom of expression is protected by the Basic Law, but there are legal limits to protect personal rights and public peace. For example, the dissemination of false allegations about persons is punishable by law (§ 186 StGB). Incitement to hatred, insults or Holocaust denial are also restricted. Criticism of the state and the government is generally permissible as long as it does not incite violence or is hostile to the constitution. Discussions about religions are allowed as long as they are not discriminatory or inflammatory. These restrictions serve to protect the democratic order and the rights of others.
