  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    A **rule of law** is a fundamental principle of German democracy. It guarantees that all state organs are bound by the law. This means that the government and administration may only exercise their power in a manner established by law. At the same time, the laws protect civil rights and ensure that individual freedoms are respected. The separation of powers, i.e. the separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers, is an essential feature of the rule of law. This ensures that abuse of power is prevented and that legal equality is guaranteed for all citizens.
