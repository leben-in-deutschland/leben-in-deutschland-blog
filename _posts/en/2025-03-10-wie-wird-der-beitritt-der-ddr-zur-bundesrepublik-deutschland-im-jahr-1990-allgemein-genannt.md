  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the end of the Cold War, intensive negotiations began on the reunification of Germany. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) joined the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. This historic process ended decades of division of Germany into East and West and led to the formation of a united, sovereign state. Reunification included the economic, political and social integration of both former German states.
