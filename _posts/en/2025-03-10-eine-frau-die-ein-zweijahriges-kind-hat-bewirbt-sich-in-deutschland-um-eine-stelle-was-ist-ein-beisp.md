  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, equal treatment in job applications is protected by law. Employers should evaluate applicants objectively, without prejudice based on personal characteristics. Nevertheless, it can happen that certain characteristics, such as parenthood, lead to disadvantages. A woman with a two-year-old child could be treated unfairly in the job allocation process if her motherhood is seen as a disadvantage. Such practices violate the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) and are considered discrimination.
