💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  a
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    A state governed by the rule of law is a basic principle of modern democracies, in which the exercise of state power is tied to laws. In a state governed by the rule of law, the laws apply equally to all citizens and to the state itself. This means that no one is above the law, including government institutions and officials. The rule of law guarantees legal certainty, protects individual civil liberties and ensures an independent judiciary that decides on disputes and violations of rights. This principle promotes justice and prevents arbitrary rule.
