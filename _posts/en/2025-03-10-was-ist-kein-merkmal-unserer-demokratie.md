💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In a democracy, regular elections play a central role because they allow citizens to freely elect their representatives. Freedom of expression is essential for citizens to be able to express their views openly. The presence of different parties promotes political competition and diversity of opinions. In contrast, press censorship restricts the freedom of the media and controls the dissemination of information. Such restrictions contradict the basic principles of a democratic society.
