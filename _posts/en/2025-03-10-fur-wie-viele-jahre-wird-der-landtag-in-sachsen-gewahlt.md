    The Landtag of Saxony is the legislative body of the Free State of Saxony in Germany. The members of parliament are elected every five years by the citizens entitled to vote. The state parliament decides on state laws, the budget and controls the state government. The electoral period determines how long the elected representatives remain in office before new elections are held.
