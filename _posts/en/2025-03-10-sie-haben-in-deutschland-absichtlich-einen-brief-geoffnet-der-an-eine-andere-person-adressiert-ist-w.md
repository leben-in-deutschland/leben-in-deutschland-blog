💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the secrecy of correspondence protects the confidentiality of postal communication. According to the law, it is forbidden to open or view other people's letters without express permission. This property right ensures that private messages between sender and recipient remain protected. The unauthorized opening of a letter thus violates basic data protection and personal rights. Such actions can result in criminal consequences and are considered an invasion of a person's privacy. Therefore, it is important to respect the secrecy of correspondence and respect the privacy of others.
