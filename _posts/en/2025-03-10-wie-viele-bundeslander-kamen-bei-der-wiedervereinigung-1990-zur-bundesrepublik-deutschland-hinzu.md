💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In 1990, German reunification took place, in which the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) joined the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). Through this process, several new federal states were created to reflect the political and administrative structures of a united Germany. These new federal states corresponded to the former districts of the GDR and were integrated into the federal system of the Federal Republic. The number of additional federal states is a central question for reunification and its organisational implementation.
