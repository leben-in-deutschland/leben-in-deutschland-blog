  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Bayern (Bavaria) is the largest federal state in Germany, divided into several administrative districts known as Landkreise. These counties handle local governance, infrastructure, and public services. To identify which option is a Landkreis in Bayern, it's essential to recognize the geographical locations of each. For instance, Altötting is located in southeastern Bavaria, making it a correct choice. In contrast, Prignitz is in Brandenburg, Rhein-Sieg-Kreis is in North Rhine-Westphalia, and Nordfriesland is in Schleswig-Holstein. Understanding Germany’s regional divisions aids in answering the question correctly.
