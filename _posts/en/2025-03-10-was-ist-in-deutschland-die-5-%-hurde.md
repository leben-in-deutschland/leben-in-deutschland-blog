  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "5% hurdle" is an essential rule in the German electoral system. It states that a party must receive at least five percent of the nationwide second votes in order to enter the Bundestag. This threshold is intended to prevent the fragmentation of parliament and enable stable government formation. Parties that do not reach the hurdle do not receive seats in parliament unless they directly win at least three constituencies. The rule has a significant influence on the chances of small parties in Bundestag elections.
