    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, a "Bürgermeister" (mayor) is the elected head of a municipality or town. The Bürgermeister is responsible for overseeing local administration, implementing municipal policies, and representing the community in official matters. This role involves managing public services, coordinating with local government councils, and ensuring the welfare of residents. Unlike positions such as a school principal ("Leiter einer Schule"), bank manager ("Chef einer Bank"), or political party leader ("Vorsitzende einer Partei"), the Bürgermeister specifically focuses on the governance and administration of the local area, making decisions that directly affect the daily lives of the community members.
