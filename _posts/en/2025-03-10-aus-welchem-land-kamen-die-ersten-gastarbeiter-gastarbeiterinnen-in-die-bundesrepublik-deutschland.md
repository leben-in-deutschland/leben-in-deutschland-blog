  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, the Federal Republic of Germany urgently needed workers for reconstruction. In the 1950s, Germany initiated the guest worker program and initially concluded an agreement with Italy. Italian workers were thus the first guest workers to come to Germany, followed by other countries such as Turkey. These guest workers made a significant contribution to the economic upswing ("economic miracle") and had a lasting impact on society.
