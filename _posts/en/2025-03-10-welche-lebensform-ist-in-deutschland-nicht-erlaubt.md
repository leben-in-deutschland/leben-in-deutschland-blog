  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, laws and social norms regulate various ways of life. Marriage is legally defined as a union between two people. Polygamous marriages, i.e. simultaneous marriages with several partners, are not allowed under German law. Other ways of life, such as single or same-sex partnerships, as well as separate partnerships after divorce, are legal and recognised. Understanding these legal frameworks helps to answer the question of prohibited lifestyles in Germany.
