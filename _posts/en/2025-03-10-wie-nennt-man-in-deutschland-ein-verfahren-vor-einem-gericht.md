    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, there are specific terms for legal processes in court. Proceedings before a court include all steps and processes that lead to the resolution of a legal dispute. Understanding this terminology is important for navigating the legal system. Terms such as "program", "procedure", "protocol" and "process" have different meanings in the legal context. In particular, the entire judicial process is often referred to as a "process", which includes the formal process from submission to judgment.
