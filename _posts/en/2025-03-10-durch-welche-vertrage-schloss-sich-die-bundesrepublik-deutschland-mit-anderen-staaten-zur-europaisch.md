  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, several Western European countries sought closer economic cooperation in order to secure peace and prosperity. In 1957, six countries, including the Federal Republic of Germany, signed the so-called "Treaties of Rome". These treaties led to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), which promoted free trade and economic integration. The Treaties of Rome formed the basis for today's European Union. Other treaty names such as Hamburg, Paris or London treaties played no role in this context.
