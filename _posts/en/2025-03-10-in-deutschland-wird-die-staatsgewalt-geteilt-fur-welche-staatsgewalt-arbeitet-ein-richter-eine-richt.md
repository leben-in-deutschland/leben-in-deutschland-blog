  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the state structure is based on the separation of powers, which divides state power into three areas: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. The legislature is responsible for legislation, i.e. the drafting and adoption of laws. The executive branch implements these laws and administers the state, for example through government and administration. The judiciary, on the other hand, is the judicial body that interprets and applies laws. Judges are part of the judiciary and work independently to ensure law and justice.
