    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, free elections refer to the fundamental democratic principle that all citizens entitled to vote have the right to vote without external coercion or restrictions. This means that each person can decide for themselves whether they want to vote, who they want to vote for and where they want to cast their vote. Free elections ensure that the electoral process is fair and independent of pressure from employers, the state or other institutions. There are only restrictions for certain groups, such as convicted criminals.
