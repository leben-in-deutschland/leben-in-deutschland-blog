    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the voting age varies depending on the type of election and the federal state. In local elections, which are determined by local representatives such as city councillors or municipal councillors, each federal state sets its own regulations. In Bavaria, for example, there are specific age limits that determine the age at which citizens are entitled to vote. This right to vote enables young people to participate in the democratic organisation of their municipality at an early stage. Understanding the legal provisions on voting age is important for participating in local decision-making processes and exercising democratic law.
