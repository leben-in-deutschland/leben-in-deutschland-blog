    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost state in Germany and is located between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The national flag consists of two horizontal stripes: white at the top and blue at the bottom. These colors symbolize the maritime tradition and coastal landscapes of the region. White often represents peace and purity, while blue represents the vastness of the sea and the sky. The simple colour scheme reflects Schleswig-Holstein's historical connection with water and is an important distinguishing feature of the state.
