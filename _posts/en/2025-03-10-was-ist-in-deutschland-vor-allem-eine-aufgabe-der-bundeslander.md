💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the political system is federally structured, which means that the federal states (16 in total) have specific responsibilities in addition to the federal government. While national tasks such as defence policy and foreign policy are taken over by the federal government, many internal affairs are reserved for the federal states. These include, among other things, economic policy and especially school policy. This division of responsibilities enables countries to design education systems according to their regional needs.
