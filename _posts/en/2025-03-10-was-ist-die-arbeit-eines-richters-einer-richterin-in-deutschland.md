  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, judges are central figures in the judicial system. Their main task is to administer justice by examining cases, evaluating evidence, and making judgments. They ensure that laws are applied correctly and that citizens' rights are respected. Judges act independently and impartially to ensure justice and resolve disputes in accordance with applicable legal provisions. They thus make a significant contribution to the maintenance of the rule of law and to the preservation of social order.
