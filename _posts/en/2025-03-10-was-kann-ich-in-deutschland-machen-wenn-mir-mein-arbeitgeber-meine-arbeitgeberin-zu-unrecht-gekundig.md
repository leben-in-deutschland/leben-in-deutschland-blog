  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, employees are protected by the Dismissal Protection Act, which is intended to prevent unfair or unjustified dismissals. If an employer terminates an employee without a valid reason, various legal steps are available. Employees can initially continue the employment relationship and seek an amicable solution. Alternatively, it is possible to file an action for protection against dismissal with the labour court. Other options include initiating dunning proceedings or, in serious cases, reporting them to the police headquarters. It is important to know the right legal steps to protect your rights.
