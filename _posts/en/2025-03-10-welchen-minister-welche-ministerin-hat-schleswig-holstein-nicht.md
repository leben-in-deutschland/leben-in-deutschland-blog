💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Schleswig-Holstein is one of the 16 federal states in Germany with its own state government. This government includes various ministries such as Justice, Finance, and Home Affairs that regulate regional affairs. However, tasks such as foreign policy typically fall under the responsibility of the federal government and not the state governments. Therefore, there may be ministries that do not exist in Schleswig-Holstein.
