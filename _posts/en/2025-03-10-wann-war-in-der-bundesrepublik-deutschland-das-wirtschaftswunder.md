    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "economic miracle" refers to the rapid economic upswing of the Federal Republic of Germany after the Second World War. In the 1950s, the country experienced strong growth, characterized by high industrial production, rising exports, and improved living standards. Factors such as the introduction of the social market economy, extensive investments in infrastructure and support from the Marshall Plan contributed significantly to this economic success. This remarkable growth led to the stabilization of the German economy and the integration of Germany into the Western European Economic Community.
