  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Between 1961 and 1989, Berlin was a central symbol of the Cold War. In 1961, East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to prevent its citizens from fleeing to West Berlin and, by extension, to West Germany and other Western countries. This wall physically and ideologically divided the city into East Berlin (controlled by the Soviet-aligned East Germany) and West Berlin (a Western enclave). The Berlin Wall became a powerful emblem of the division between the communist Eastern Bloc and the democratic West, affecting the lives of Berliners and international relations until its fall in 1989.
