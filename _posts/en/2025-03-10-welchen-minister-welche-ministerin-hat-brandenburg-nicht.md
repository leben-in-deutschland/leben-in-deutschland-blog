  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Brandenburg is a federal state in eastern Germany and has several state ministries that cover different administrative areas. Typical ministries in Brandenburg are the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior, which are responsible for law, finance and internal security. However, there is no foreign ministry in Brandenburg, as foreign policy and international relations are regulated at the federal level by the federal government. Therefore, "Foreign Minister" is not an office within the state government of Brandenburg.
