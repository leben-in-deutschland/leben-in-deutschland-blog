  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    German is one of the most widely spoken languages in Europe and is not only spoken in Germany. An important German-speaking country is Austria, where German is the official language and the majority of the population speaks German. In addition, there are historical German-speaking minorities in the Czech Republic. Other countries such as Norway and Spain, on the other hand, have few or no German-speaking communities worth mentioning. This knowledge helps to understand the question of countries with large German-speaking populations.
