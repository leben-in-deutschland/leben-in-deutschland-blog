  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Federal Republic of Germany is based on a basic legal order that functions as a constitution. After the Second World War, the Basic Law was passed in 1949 to define the political structures and the fundamental rights of citizens. The Basic Law serves as the highest legal basis of the state and regulates the organisation of state institutions and the relations between the Federation and the Länder. It ensures democratic principles, the rule of law and the protection of individual freedoms. Understanding this constitution is essential for knowledge of Germany's political system and legal framework.
