  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Bavaria, as one of the federal states of Germany, has a state government that includes various ministries to manage regional affairs. Typical ministerial positions in Bavaria are the Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of the Interior, who are responsible for law, finance and internal security. However, foreign policy and diplomatic relations fall under federal competence, so that Bavaria does not have its own foreign minister. This responsibility lies with the Federal Ministry of Finance at national level.
