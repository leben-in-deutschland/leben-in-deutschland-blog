  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen is one of the 16 federal states of Germany and has its own state parliament, the Bremen Parliament. This body is responsible for legislation at the state level, budget planning and control of the state government. The members of the parliament are determined by elections, in which the citizens of Bremen elect their representatives. The length of the term of office of the members of parliament determines how often elections are held and how long a legislative period lasts. Understanding the electoral periods is important for political planning and citizen participation.
