💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The year of separation is a legal requirement for divorce in Germany. During this year, the spouses must live separately to show that the marriage is actually to be ended. This phase is intended to give both parties time to think about the separation and to examine possible reconciliation options. Only after the end of the year of separation can the divorce be officially filed. The year of separation thus serves as proof of the seriousness of the separation and is intended to prevent unnecessary divorces.
