    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is divided into 16 federal states, each with its own administrative structures and cultural identities. Berlin is a special region because it is both a city and an independent state. As the capital of Germany, Berlin plays a central role in the country's politics, economy and culture. In geographical and administrative contexts, Berlin is therefore often considered one of the federal states.
