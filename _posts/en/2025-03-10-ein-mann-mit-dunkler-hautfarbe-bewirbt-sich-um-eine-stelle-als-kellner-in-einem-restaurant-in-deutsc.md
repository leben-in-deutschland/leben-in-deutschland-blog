    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    This question deals with the topic of discrimination in the labour market in Germany. She describes an applicant with dark skin who applies for a job as a waiter and asks what reason for rejection is discriminatory. The General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) protects against discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin. The aim is to identify which of the reasons given (German language skills, salary expectations, skin colour, professional experience) actually constitute unfair discrimination.
