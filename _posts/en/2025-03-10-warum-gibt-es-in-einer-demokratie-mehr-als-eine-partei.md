  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In a democracy, political parties play a central role, as they bundle and represent different opinions and interests of citizens. Several parties enable a diverse political landscape in which different ideologies and proposed solutions are up for discussion. This promotes political competition and ensures that no single group monopolizes all decisions. In addition, several parties strengthen the accountability of politicians, as they have to answer to their constituencies. This makes democracy more lively and representative, as different social groups are heard.
