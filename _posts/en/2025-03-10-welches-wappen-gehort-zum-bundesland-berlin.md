    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany consists of 16 federal states, each of which has its own coat of arms as a state symbol. These coats of arms reflect the historical and cultural identity of the respective federal state. Berlin, the capital of Germany, is both a city-state and a federal state, so it has a unique coat of arms. In exams or quizzes, such symbols are often asked to test knowledge about the federal structure and the individual federal states. The present question aims to identify the correct coat of arms of Berlin from the given options.
