    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In democratic systems, citizens elect representatives who represent their interests in parliament. These elected individuals play a central role in legislating, controlling the government, and representing the population. There are various political offices with specific tasks: members of parliament work directly in parliament, chancellors lead the federal government, ambassadors represent the country abroad, and minister-presidents head the governments of the federal states. Understanding these positions is important to recognize the political structure and responsibilities within the state.
