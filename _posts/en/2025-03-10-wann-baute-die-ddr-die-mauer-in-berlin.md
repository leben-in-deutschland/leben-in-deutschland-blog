  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany was divided into East and West. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) was created in the east under Soviet influence. In the 1960s, there was an increase in emigration from East to West Germany via Berlin. In order to stop this escape and secure the border, the GDR government decided to build a physical barrier around West Berlin. This wall was intended to prevent emigration and became a symbol of the Cold War.
