    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The National Socialist State (Nazi State) under the leadership of Adolf Hitler ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. This state was characterized by a totalitarian form of government that exercised ideological control over society and the economy. Central elements were the systematic persecution and discrimination of certain population groups, especially on the basis of racist ideologies. In addition, fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and religion have been severely restricted, while democratic structures have been abolished. Propaganda and state surveillance played an essential role in maintaining National Socialist rule.
