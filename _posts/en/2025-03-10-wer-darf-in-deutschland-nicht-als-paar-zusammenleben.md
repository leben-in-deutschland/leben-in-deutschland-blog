  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, there are legal provisions that determine who is allowed to live together as a couple. Important factors are the minimum age for consent to cohabitation and the existence of a consensual relationship without power imbalances. Relationships between adolescents and significantly older partners can be problematic, especially if one of the partners is still a minor. In addition, all persons involved must meet the legal requirements for a partnership relationship in order to ensure protection and rights within the partnership.
