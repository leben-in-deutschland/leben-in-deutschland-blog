  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, all German citizens who have reached the age of 18 are allowed to vote in Bundestag elections. The prerequisite is German citizenship and reaching the minimum age of 18 years. It doesn't matter how long you live in Germany, as long as you have citizenship. Persons under the age of 18 or non-citizens do not have the right to vote in the Bundestag election. This right to vote ensures that only eligible citizens can participate in the election.
