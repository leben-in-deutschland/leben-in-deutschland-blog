💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, labor law protects employees from unfair dismissal. Certain grounds are inadmissible, in particular discrimination such as pregnancy or parenthood. A woman may not be dismissed because she is having a child, as this violates the Maternity Protection Act. Other reasons such as frequent lateness, long periods of illness or taking care of private matters during working hours may be legally permissible under certain conditions. This protection system is intended to ensure that dismissals are fair and comprehensible.
