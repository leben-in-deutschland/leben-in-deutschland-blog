💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, citizens at different levels elect their representatives through different procedures. Direct elections allow the election of members of the Bundestag, state parliament and members of the EU Parliament. These deputies are directly elected by the voters. The Federal President, on the other hand, is not elected directly by the citizens, but by the Federal Assembly, which is made up of the members of the Bundestag and representatives of the federal states. This indirect election procedure distinguishes the Federal President from the other positions mentioned.
