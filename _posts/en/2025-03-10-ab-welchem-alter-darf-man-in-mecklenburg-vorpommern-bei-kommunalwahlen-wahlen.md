  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the voting age varies depending on the type of election and the federal state. In local elections that affect local affairs such as city administration and municipal councils, some federal states have younger voters. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has specific regulations that make it possible for young people from a certain age to participate in these elections. Setting the voting age influences the political participation and engagement of young citizens in local decision-making processes.
