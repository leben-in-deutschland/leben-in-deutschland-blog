  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Thuringia is a central state in Germany, known for its rich history and diverse landscape. It is divided into several counties (counties), each of which takes on its own administrative tasks. Examples of districts in Thuringia are the Wartburgkreis, named after the famous Wartburg Castle, and the Eichsfeldkreis, a historic region. Other districts in the state such as North Frisia or Ammerland, on the other hand, do not belong to Thuringia, but to other federal states. This knowledge helps to identify the correct answer to the question.
