    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the population prepares for Christmas in the last four weeks before Christmas. This time is called **Advent time**. During the Advent season, many traditions such as Advent calendars, Advent candles and Christmas markets bring joy and anticipation. It differs from other holidays: The **Day of Repentance and Prayer** is a day of prayer, the **Thanksgiving** celebrates the harvest, and **All Saints' Day** honors the saints. The Advent season focuses specifically on pre-Christmas preparation and contemplation.
