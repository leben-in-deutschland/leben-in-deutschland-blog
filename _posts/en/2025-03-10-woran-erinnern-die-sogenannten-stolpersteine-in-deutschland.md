    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "Stolpersteine" are small memorial plaques that are laid by artists in the sidewalks in front of the former homes of victims of National Socialism in Germany. Each stick bears the name, date of birth and fate of the person concerned. They serve as a reminder of the individual fates of people who were persecuted, deported or murdered during the Nazi era and are intended to keep the memory of these victims present in everyday life.
