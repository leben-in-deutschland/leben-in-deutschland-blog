  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is one of the 16 federal states of Germany and has a state government with various ministries. Typical ministries include Justice, Finance and Home Affairs, which are responsible for the legal system, budget and internal security. However, foreign affairs in Germany usually deal with the federal government, so not every state has its own foreign ministry. Therefore, there is no foreign minister in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
