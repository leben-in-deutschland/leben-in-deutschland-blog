  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the legal system is divided into different branches of the courts, each of which deals with specific conflicts. Labour disputes, such as dismissals, salary issues or collective bargaining disputes between employers and employees, require specialised court proceedings. These types of cases are not handled by general or family court instances, but by special labour courts that specialise in finding fair solutions in the working environment.
