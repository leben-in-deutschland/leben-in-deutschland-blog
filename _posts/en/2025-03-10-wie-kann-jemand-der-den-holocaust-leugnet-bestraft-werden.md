  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, Holocaust denial is punishable by law. The Criminal Code (§ 130 "Incitement to hatred") prohibits the denial, trivialization or approval of genocide, especially the Holocaust. These acts are considered incitement to hatred because they disturb the public peace and slander historical truth. The legal consequences can be considerable and range from fines to imprisonment. These legal regulations are intended to preserve the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and prevent the spread of hatred and extremism.
