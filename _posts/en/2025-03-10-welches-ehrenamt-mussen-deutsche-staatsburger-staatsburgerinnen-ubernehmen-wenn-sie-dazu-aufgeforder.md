  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, there are certain voluntary activities to which citizens can be called upon if necessary. Such tasks support public institutions and social processes. A common example is poll workers who help with the conduct of elections. Other positions such as club trainer, library supervisor or teacher are usually voluntary and are not necessarily demanded by the state. Understanding this distinction is important in order to know which honorary offices must be taken on when requested.
