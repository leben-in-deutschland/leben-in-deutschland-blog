  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the church tax plays an important role in the tax system. Members of certain religious communities, such as the Catholic or Protestant churches, pay a church tax in addition to income and wage tax. This tax is collected directly by the state and passed on to the respective church. Therefore, taxpayers must state in their tax return whether they belong to a church or not. This information is necessary to calculate the correct amount of taxes to be paid. Without this information, the church tax cannot be determined correctly.
