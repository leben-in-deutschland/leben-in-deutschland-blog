💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  a
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Lower Saxony, there are several contact points where citizens can find out about political topics. The **State Agency for Civic Education** offers extensive materials, events and educational programmes on current political issues. In contrast, the **public order office of the municipality** mainly deals with local regulations and safety. The **Consumer Advice Centre** mainly provides information on consumer rights and protection, while **the churches** mostly deal with ethical and social issues, but are not the focus of political education. Thus, the state headquarters is the central address for political information in Lower Saxony.
