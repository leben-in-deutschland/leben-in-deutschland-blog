    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    A "traffic light coalition" in Germany refers to a government constellation consisting of three parties: the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) – red, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) – yellow and Alliance 90/The Greens – green. The term "traffic light" is derived from the respective party colors, similar to the colors of a traffic light. Such coalitions enable the parties to bundle their different political goals and jointly form a government majority in the Bundestag.
