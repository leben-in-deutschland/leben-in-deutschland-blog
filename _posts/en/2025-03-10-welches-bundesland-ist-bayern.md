    Germany is divided into 16 federal states, known as Bundesländer, each with its own government and unique cultural identity. These states vary in size, population, and economic significance. For example, Bavaria (Bayern) is the largest state by area, located in the southeast, with Munich as its capital. Other notable states include Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony.
