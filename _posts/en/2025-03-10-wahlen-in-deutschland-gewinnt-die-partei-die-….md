    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, Bundestag elections are held according to a personalized proportional representation system. Each voter has two votes: the first vote for a direct candidate in the constituency and the second vote for a party. The second votes decide decisively on the distribution of seats in parliament. The party that receives the most second votes wins the election and usually forms the government. This system ensures that the party results are proportional to the will of the voters and at the same time that there is direct representation by the first votes.
