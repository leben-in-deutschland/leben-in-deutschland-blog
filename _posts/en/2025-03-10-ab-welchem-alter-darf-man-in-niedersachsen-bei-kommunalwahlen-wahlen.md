    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the voting age and regulations for local elections vary depending on the federal state. Lower Saxony, as one of the 16 federal states, determines the age at which citizens are allowed to vote in local elections. These elections determine the representatives in city and municipal councils who make important local decisions. The minimum age to participate can be between 14 and 20 years old, depending on the legal requirements and political discussions on the involvement of young people in the democratic process. Understanding these regulations is essential for eligibility.
