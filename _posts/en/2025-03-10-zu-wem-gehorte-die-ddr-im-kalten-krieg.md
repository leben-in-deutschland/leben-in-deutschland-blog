  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    During the Cold War, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was a socialist state in Eastern Europe. It belonged to the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance of Eastern European countries led by the Soviet Union. The pact stood in contrast to NATO, the Western powers and the non-aligned states, which took a neutral position. The GDR was thus part of the Eastern Bloc and closely linked to the communist states.
