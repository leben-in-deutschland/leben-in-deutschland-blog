  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the education system is a matter for the states. The 16 federal states have the main responsibility for school policy and determine curricula, educational standards and school structures. They also coordinate the training of teachers and the financing of schools. Although teachers and universities play important roles in education, the political decision-making power lies with the federal states. The Ministry of Family Affairs supports educational policy measures, but has no direct influence on school policy. This federal structure enables the federal states to adapt education policy to regional needs.
