    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Statutory social insurance in Germany includes several mandatory areas that protect employees and certain self-employed persons. These include statutory pension insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance and long-term care insurance. These schemes provide financial support in old age, unemployment, illness and long-term care. In contrast, life insurance, which is usually taken out privately and is not part of the statutory social insurance. It serves to provide individual security and financial provision, independent of the state social security systems.
