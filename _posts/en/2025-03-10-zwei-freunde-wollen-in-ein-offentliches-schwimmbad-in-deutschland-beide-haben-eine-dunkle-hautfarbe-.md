💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, public facilities such as swimming pools are obliged to provide access to all people, regardless of their skin colour. Discrimination on the basis of skin colour violates basic human rights and laws that are intended to ensure equal treatment and equal rights. If two friends with dark skin are turned away because of their appearance, it is a violation of these legal requirements. Such incidents raise questions about compliance with anti-discrimination laws and the protection of individual freedoms in society.
