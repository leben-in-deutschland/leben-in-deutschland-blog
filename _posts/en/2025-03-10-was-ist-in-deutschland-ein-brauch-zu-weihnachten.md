    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, Christmas has a long tradition with a variety of customs. The decorated Christmas tree, which is often erected on Christmas Eve, plays a central role. Families decorate the tree with lights, baubles and other ornaments. Other typical activities include baking cookies, singing Christmas carols, and giving gifts.
