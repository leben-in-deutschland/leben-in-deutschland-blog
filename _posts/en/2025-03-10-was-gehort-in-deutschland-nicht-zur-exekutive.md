  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, state power is divided into three areas: legislative (legislative), executive (executive power) and judiciary (judiciary). The executive branch includes institutions such as the police, ministries, and the tax office, which are responsible for enforcing and administering laws. The courts, on the other hand, belong to the judiciary and are responsible for adjudication and judicial decisions. This understanding helps to identify which institutions belong to the executive and which do not.
