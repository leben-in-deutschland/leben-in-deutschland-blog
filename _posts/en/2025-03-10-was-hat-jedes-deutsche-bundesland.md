💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is a federal state divided into 16 federal states. Each federal state has its own institutions and competencies in areas such as education, police and culture. The federal states thus have a certain autonomy, while certain tasks, such as foreign policy and defense, are regulated at the federal level. This structure makes it possible to take into account regional peculiarities and ensure decentralised administration. The question examines the understanding of the responsibilities and structures within the German federal states.
