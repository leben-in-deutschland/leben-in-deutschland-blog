    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the end of World War II in 1945, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, which were controlled by the victorious Allied powers. Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the USA and France each took over a zone to coordinate the administration and reconstruction of the country. This division was intended to promote democratic development and prevent a renewed threat of militarism. In addition, Berlin, although located deep in the Soviet zone, was also divided into four sectors. The exact distribution of the zones had a significant influence on the later political development of Germany.
