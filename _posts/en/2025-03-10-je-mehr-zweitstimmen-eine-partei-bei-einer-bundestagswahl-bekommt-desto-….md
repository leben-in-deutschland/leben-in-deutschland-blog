    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany's Bundestag elections, voters have two votes: the first vote for a direct candidate in the constituency and the second vote for a party list. The second votes determine the proportional share of each party in parliament. The more second votes a party receives, the more seats it receives in the Bundestag in total. This system promotes a more representative representation of the will of the voters and influences the distribution of seats as well as possible coalition formations between parties.
