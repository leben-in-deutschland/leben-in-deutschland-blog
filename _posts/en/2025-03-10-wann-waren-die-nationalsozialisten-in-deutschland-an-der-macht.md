    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The National Socialists, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, were a political party in Germany that gained influence after World War I. Through economic crises and political instability, they used their propaganda and charisma to seize power in 1933. During their rule until 1945, they established a totalitarian dictatorship, fought the Second World War and committed the Holocaust. This period had a lasting impact on German history and ended with Germany's defeat in 1945.
