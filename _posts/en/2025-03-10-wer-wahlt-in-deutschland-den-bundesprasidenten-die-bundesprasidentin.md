    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Federal President is the head of state of the Federal Republic of Germany and performs representative tasks. Unlike the Federal Chancellor, he is not directly elected by the people. Instead, the election takes place through a special assembly. This assembly is composed of the members of the German Bundestag and representatives of the federal states. The Federal President plays an important role in promoting the democratic process and the representation of Germany at home and abroad.
