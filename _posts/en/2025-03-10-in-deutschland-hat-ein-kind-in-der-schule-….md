    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, school attendance for children is regulated by law. The school law determines what rights and obligations pupils have. These include, among other things, the obligation to attend classes regularly and certain freedoms in the choice of subjects. School fees are usually not provided for in public schools. Leisure regulations and the structure of the school day are also determined by legal provisions. This set of rules ensures that all children receive a uniform and regulated education.
