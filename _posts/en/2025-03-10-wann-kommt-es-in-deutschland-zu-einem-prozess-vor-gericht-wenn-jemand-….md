  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, court proceedings are initiated when there are legal conflicts or criminal offences that require legal clarification. A trial in court is typical when someone is accused of a crime and is formally charged. This includes both serious offences and less serious offences that must be tried in court. Other situations, such as religious changes, disagreements with the government, or minor traffic violations, usually do not result in legal proceedings because they either have no criminal relevance or are otherwise administratively regulated.
