  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the German Bundestag, the President is elected to maintain order during sessions, to enforce the rules of procedure and to represent the Bundestag externally. The person in this office plays a central role in the organisation of parliamentary work and acts as a neutral authority vis-à-vis the parliamentary groups. As a rule, the president comes from the strongest parliamentary group and has extensive experience and the trust of the deputies. This knowledge helps to understand the selection criteria for the election of the President of the Bundestag.
