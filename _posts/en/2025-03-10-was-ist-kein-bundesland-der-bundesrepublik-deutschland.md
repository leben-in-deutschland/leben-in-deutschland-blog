💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is the Federal Republic of Germany with 16 federal states, each with its own administrations and political structures. The well-known federal states include North Rhine-Westphalia, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt. These regions play a central role in German politics and business. However, there are historical areas that no longer exist as federal states today. One such area is Alsace-Lorraine, which currently belongs largely to France and is not a federal state of Germany. Alsace-Lorraine is therefore not to be regarded as one of the Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany.
