    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Anti-Semitism refers to prejudice, discrimination, or hostile behavior toward Jews as a religious or ethnic group. Such attitudes can be subtle or overt, for example through stereotypical statements, exclusions in social or professional spheres, or denial of historical events such as the Holocaust. Recognizing and understanding anti-Semitic behavior is important to break down prejudice and promote a respectful and inclusive society.
