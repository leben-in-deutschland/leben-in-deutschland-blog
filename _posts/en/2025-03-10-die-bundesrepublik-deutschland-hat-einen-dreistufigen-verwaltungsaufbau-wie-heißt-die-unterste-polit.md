    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Federal Republic of Germany is organised on a federal basis and has a three-tier administrative structure. The first level is the federal government, which is responsible for national affairs such as foreign policy and defence. The second level consists of the federal states, which have their own competences in areas such as education and the police. The lowest political level is the municipal level, which consists of municipalities. Municipalities manage local tasks such as urban planning, waste disposal, and local infrastructure. This system enables decentralized administration and efficiently takes regional needs into account.
