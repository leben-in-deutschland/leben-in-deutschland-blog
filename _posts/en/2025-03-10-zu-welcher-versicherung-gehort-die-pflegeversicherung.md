  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Long-term care insurance is an important pillar of the German social security system. It offers financial support and benefits for people who become dependent on care due to illness or old age. In addition to long-term care insurance, social insurance also includes health, pension and unemployment insurance. In contrast, accident insurance covers accidents at work, household insurance covers the protection of household items, and liability and fire insurance covers damage caused by liability or fire. Understanding these types of insurance helps to make the correct classification.
