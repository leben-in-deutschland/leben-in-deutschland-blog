    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The European Union (EU) is an association of European countries that share political and economic goals. Since its inception, the EU has continuously absorbed members, making it one of the largest political blocs in the world. The number of member states influences decisions, legislation and cooperation in areas such as trade, security and the environment. Current enlargement processes and political developments can change the number of members, which is why it is important to be informed about the latest developments.
