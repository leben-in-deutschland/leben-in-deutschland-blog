    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Landtag is the parliament of the Saarland, one of the 16 federal states of Germany. It represents the citizens and is responsible for legislation at the state level. The members of the state parliament are elected in regular electoral periods, which are laid down in the state constitution. These electoral periods determine how long the elected representatives hold office before new elections are called. The term of office can vary from state to state and affects political stability and continuity in the state government.
