    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Basic Law is the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany and lays down the fundamental rights and principles that govern social and legal coexistence. It includes, among other things, the protection of human dignity, the equality of all before the law and freedom of expression. These provisions form the basis for state action and the protection of civil rights. In the context of exam questions, it is important to know which statements are actually anchored in the Basic Law and which are not, in order to avoid misinterpretations.
