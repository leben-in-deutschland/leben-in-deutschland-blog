    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the protection of children is enshrined in law. Physical violence against children is punishable under the Criminal Code (§ 176 StGB). The aim of these laws is to protect children from abuse and neglect and to ensure their well-being. Parents or guardians who hit a child can be prosecuted, which can lead to fines or imprisonment. In addition, social services intervene to support the child and prevent further violence. This legal system ensures that the best interests of the child come first.
