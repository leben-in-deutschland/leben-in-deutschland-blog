  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Thuringia, one of Germany's 16 federal states, has a state government system with various ministries covering specific areas of responsibility. Typical ministerial posts at the state level include Justice, Finance and Home Affairs, which are responsible for justice, budget management, and security and administration. However, foreign affairs fall within the area of responsibility of the federal government, which is why there is no foreign ministry at the state level in Thuringia. This structural model reflects the federal organization of Germany, in which certain competences are centralized.
