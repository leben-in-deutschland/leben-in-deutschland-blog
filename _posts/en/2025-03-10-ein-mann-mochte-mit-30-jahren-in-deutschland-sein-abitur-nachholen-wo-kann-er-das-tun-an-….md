  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, many adults want to catch up on their Abitur in order to improve their career opportunities or to take up a course of study. Various educational institutions are available for this purpose. An evening high school offers flexible courses outside of regular working hours, ideal for working professionals. **Colleges** and **private universities** are primarily geared towards studies and usually do not offer Abitur courses. **Hauptschulen**, on the other hand, are aimed at younger students and do not offer the opportunity to acquire the Abitur. Therefore, the evening grammar school is the right choice for a 30-year-old man who wants to catch up on his Abitur.
