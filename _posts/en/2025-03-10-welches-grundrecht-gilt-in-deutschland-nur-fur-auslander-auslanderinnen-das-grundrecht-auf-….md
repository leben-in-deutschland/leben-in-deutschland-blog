  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, fundamental rights are enshrined in the Basic Law, which apply to both citizens and foreigners. However, there are certain rights that are specifically aimed at foreigners and their residence status. These rights are intended to ensure the protection and integration of people who do not have German citizenship. For example, the right to asylum plays a central role for those seeking protection, while other fundamental rights such as human dignity apply universally. Understanding these differences is important for legal issues in the context of migration.
