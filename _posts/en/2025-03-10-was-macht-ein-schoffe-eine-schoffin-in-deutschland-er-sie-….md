    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, lay judges play an important role in the judicial system. Lay judges are honorary lay judges who decide together with professional judges in criminal and some civil proceedings. They bring the perspective of the population into the court decisions and are involved in the decision-making process, especially in the determination of guilt and the assessment of penalties. Lay judges have no legal training, but assume equal voting rights as judges. Their task is not to give legal advice, issue documents or take over the defense of the accused.
