💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the parliament is the central institution for legislation at the federal level. The **Bundestag** is the regular parliament in which members of parliament are represented and conduct debates. The **Federal Convention** meets only to elect the President. The **People's Chamber** was the parliament of the GDR before reunification. The Federal Court of Justice, on the other hand, is the highest court and not a parliament. 

These differences help to understand which body takes on the main legislative role throughout Germany.
