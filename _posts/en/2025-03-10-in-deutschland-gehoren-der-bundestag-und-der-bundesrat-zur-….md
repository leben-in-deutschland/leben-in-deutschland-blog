💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Bundestag plays a central role as the main elected legislative body, in which the members of parliament represent the interests of the citizens. The Bundesrat, on the other hand, consists of representatives of the 16 federal states and participates in legislation, especially in laws that affect the states. Both institutions work together within the political system to draft, discuss and pass laws. They are therefore essential components of the legislature, responsible for legislation and the control of the executive.
