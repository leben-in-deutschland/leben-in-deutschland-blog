    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, the territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) belonged to East Germany. The GDR comprised several regions that were integrated into the reunified Germany as new federal states after reunification. Today's federal states such as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia were formerly part of the GDR. This historical background knowledge makes it easier to understand the question of which current German state used to belong to the GDR.
