💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, reaching the age of majority plays an important role in everyday legal life. At the age of 18, a person is considered to be of age, which gives him or her all civil rights and obligations. These include the right to vote, the ability to conclude contracts independently, and full responsibility for one's own actions. Before the age of 18, different age limits apply to certain rights, such as the Commercial Act or the acquisition of a driving licence. The age of majority thus decisively determines a person's legal status and ability to act in society.
