  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, pregnant women are particularly protected by **maternity protection**. This legal protection applies both shortly before and after the birth of a child. Maternity protection includes measures such as protection against dismissal, protection against health hazards in the workplace, paid maternity leave and time off from work during the recovery period after childbirth. The aim is to ensure the health of the mother and child and to ensure a stress-free working environment. Maternity protection is an important part of German labour law and supports expectant mothers during pregnancy and after childbirth.
