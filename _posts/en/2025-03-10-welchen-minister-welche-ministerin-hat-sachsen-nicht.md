💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Sachsen (Saxony) is a federal state in Germany with its own state government responsible for areas like justice, finance, and interior affairs. State governments typically have ministers overseeing these domains to manage regional policies and administration. However, certain ministries, such as foreign affairs, are handled exclusively at the national level by the federal government. This means that while Saxony has ministers for justice, finance, and interior matters, it does not have a dedicated foreign minister, as international relations are managed by Germany’s central government.
