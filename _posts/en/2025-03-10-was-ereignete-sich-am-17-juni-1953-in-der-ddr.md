  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    On June 17, 1953, nationwide strikes and a popular uprising broke out in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Workers and citizens protested against rising labor standards, poor living conditions and the authoritarian rule of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The demonstrations began in East Berlin and quickly spread to other cities. Despite initial successes in demanding political reforms, the uprisings were eventually violently suppressed by Soviet troops and the People's Police. This event is considered a significant resistance against the GDR regime.
