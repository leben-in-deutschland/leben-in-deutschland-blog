  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the school system is predominantly organised by the state. The federal states are responsible for education policy and ensure that all students have access to quality education. State control establishes uniform educational standards that ensure equal opportunities and ensure that all pupils acquire a recognised school-leaving certificate. In addition, state supervision is anchored in the Basic Law, which defines education as a public task and enables the diversity of school types in the individual federal states.
