    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German Democratic Republic (GDR) had a unique coat of arms that symbolized its socialist identity. In the centre of the coat of arms was a red emblem with a hammer and compass, which stand for workers and intellectuals. Above it was an ear of corn, which represents agriculture. The symbol was surrounded by a star that emphasized communist ideology. This coat of arms reflected the unity of industry and agriculture as well as the socialist principles of the GDR. Understanding these symbols helps to better classify the question of the specific coat of arms of the GDR.
