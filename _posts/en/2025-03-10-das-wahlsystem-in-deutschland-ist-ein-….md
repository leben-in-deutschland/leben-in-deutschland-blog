    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, parliament is elected through a mixed electoral system that combines elements of majority voting and proportional representation. This system makes it possible to have direct representatives from constituencies as well as to distribute seats in parliament in proportion to the party votes received. The aim is to ensure a fair and balanced representation of voters' opinions and at the same time to support the stable formation of a government. Understanding this dual system is crucial for answering the question about the German electoral system.
