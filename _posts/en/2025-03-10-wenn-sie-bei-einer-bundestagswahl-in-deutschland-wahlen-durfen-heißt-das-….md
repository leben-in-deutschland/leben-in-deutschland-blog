  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Bundestag elections in Germany, citizens entitled to vote exercise their democratic right to elect representatives to parliament. This right is called the "active right to vote" and allows citizens to participate in political opinion-forming and decision-making. In contrast to this are terms such as election campaign (the campaign of the parties), electoral procedure (the course of the election) and election campaign (the dispute between the parties before the election). The right to vote is fundamental for democracy and representative governance in Germany.
