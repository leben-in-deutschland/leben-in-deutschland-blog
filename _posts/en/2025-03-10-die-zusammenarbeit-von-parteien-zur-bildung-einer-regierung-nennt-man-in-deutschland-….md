    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the political system consists of several parties that are represented in the Bundestag. After a Bundestag election, the parties often need to work together to form a majority government. This cooperation enables them to pursue common political goals and ensure a stable government. Such alliances are achieved through agreements and negotiations between the parties, giving them the necessary support in parliament to pass laws and govern the country.
