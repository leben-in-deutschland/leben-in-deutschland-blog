    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, Baden-Württemberg is one of the 16 federal states in the southwest of the country. Each state is divided into several districts that provide local administration and services. For example, the Neckar-Odenwald district belongs to Baden-Württemberg. Other districts such as Mecklenburg Lake District, North Frisia and Altötting are located in other federal states such as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria, respectively. Understanding the assignment of districts to their federal states is important for geographical and administrative knowledge.
