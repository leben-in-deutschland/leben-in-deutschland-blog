💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the separation of powers is based on the separation of three main powers: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. The **legislative power** lies with Parliament, which makes laws. The **executive power** includes the government and administration that implements laws. The **judiciary** is exercised by the independent courts, which decide disputes and monitor compliance with the law. This division ensures mutual control and prevents concentration of power. Terms such as **planning violence** are not common in this context.
