    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In parliamentary democracies, the term "opposition" refers to the parties or MPs that are not part of the governing coalition. The opposition plays an important role by critically monitoring the government's work, putting forward alternative proposals and stimulating debate. It ensures that different opinions are represented in parliament and contributes to the control and balance of power. The opposition can influence legislative procedures and serves as a constructive opponent to the ruling party. Understanding this role is essential in order to understand the function and dynamics of a parliament.
