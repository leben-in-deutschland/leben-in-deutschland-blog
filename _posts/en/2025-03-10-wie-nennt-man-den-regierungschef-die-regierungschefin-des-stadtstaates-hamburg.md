💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Hamburg is one of Germany's 16 city states and has its own state government. The head of government heads this government and represents Hamburg at the federal level. Unlike other federal states that have a prime minister, Hamburg uses special titles for its governance. The correct designation for the leading person in Hamburg thus differs from the usual titles in other German states.
