💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  a
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, permanent employees have to pay various taxes from their salaries. These include income tax, contributions to unemployment insurance as well as pension and health insurance. These deductions are required by law and are used to finance social benefits and the state budget. Sales tax, on the other hand, is a consumption tax that is levied on goods and services and is not directly deducted from employees' salaries. Therefore, Ms. Frost does not have to pay VAT from her salary.
