💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany developed an economic system that combines market economy principles with social security systems. This model promotes free competition and entrepreneurial freedom, while ensuring social justice and government intervention to stabilize the economy. The aim is to create prosperity and at the same time cushion social risks. This special form of economy differs from purely free or centrally planned economic systems and still shapes the economic and social fabric of Germany today.
