    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The state parliament is the parliament of the state of Lower Saxony and plays a central role in state politics. It is made up of elected representatives who represent the interests of the citizens. The legislative period determines how long these MPs remain in office before new elections are called. The electoral period influences the stability and planning security of the state government as well as the implementation of political programmes. Understanding the election cycles is therefore essential for political awareness and the participation of citizens in the democratic process in Lower Saxony.
