  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After World War II, Germany was divided into two states: the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the west and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the east. The GDR was a member of the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance of Eastern European states led by the Soviet Union. In contrast, the FRG belonged to NATO. Other alliances such as the Confederation of the Rhine or the European Alliance either did not exist or did not include the GDR.
