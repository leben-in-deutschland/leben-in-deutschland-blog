  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Basic Law regulates the conditions under which a political party can be banned. According to Article 21, a party can be banned if it actively endangers the free democratic basic order or wants to abolish the constitutional order. Such bans are issued by the Federal Constitutional Court and require convincing evidence of unconstitutional action. Historically, party bans have rarely been imposed, usually in connection with extremist tendencies that threaten the democratic structure of society.
