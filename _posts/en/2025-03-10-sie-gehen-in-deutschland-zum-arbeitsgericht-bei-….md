  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Labour Court in Germany specialises in disputes between employees and employers. It handles cases such as unfair terminations, salary issues, or contract conflicts. Employees turn to the labour court if they need legal assistance with problems in the workplace. In contrast, other courts or authorities have jurisdiction over rental disputes, neighborhood issues, or traffic accidents. This understanding helps to choose appropriate legal steps depending on the nature of the conflict.
