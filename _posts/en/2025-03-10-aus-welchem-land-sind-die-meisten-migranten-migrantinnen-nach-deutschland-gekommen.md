  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Over the years, Germany has taken in a large number of migrants from different countries. Historically, economic agreements and labour requirements have played a major role in immigration. Especially after the Second World War, many guest workers came to Germany to support the reconstruction. In addition to economic reasons, family and political factors also influence migration movements. Today, most migrants come from different regions, with some countries providing significantly more immigrants than others. This dynamic has a significant influence on cultural diversity and social development in Germany.
