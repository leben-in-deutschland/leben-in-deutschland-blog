  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is divided into 16 states, each with its own government and culture. These federal states are often numbered to make them easier to assign. For example, a list might look like this: 1. Bavaria, 2. North Rhine-Westphalia, 3. Baden-Württemberg, 4. Hesse. Such numbering facilitates learning and identification of the individual federal states. The question aims to test the knowledge about the assignment of Baden-Württemberg within this list.
