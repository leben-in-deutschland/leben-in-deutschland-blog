    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany consists of 16 federal states, which have different structures. Some of these federal states are so-called city-states, which means that they mainly comprise a large city and its immediate surroundings. These city-states have a special administrative structure, as they operate at both municipal and state level. Examples of city-states are Hamburg and Berlin. In contrast, other federal states such as Saxony, Bavaria and Thuringia are territorial states with several cities and regions. The question aims to test knowledge about the structure of the German federal states.
