    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the principle of religious tolerance is an essential part of social coexistence. This principle guarantees that every person has the right to freely practice his or her religion or not to belong to any religion, without discrimination or paternalism by the state. Religious freedom is anchored in the Basic Law and promotes a diverse and respectful coexistence of different faiths. This creates an open society in which different religious beliefs are accepted and protected.
