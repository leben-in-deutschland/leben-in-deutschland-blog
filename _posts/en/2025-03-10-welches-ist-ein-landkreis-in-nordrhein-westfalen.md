  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    North Rhine-Westphalia is one of the 16 federal states of Germany and is divided into several districts. A district, such as the Rhein-Sieg district, administers local affairs outside the independent cities. Ammerland belongs to Lower Saxony, North Frisia to Schleswig-Holstein and Vogtlandkreis to Saxony. These administrative units play an important role in regional organisation, infrastructure and public services. Understanding the districts helps with orientation within the German federal states and their administrative structures.
