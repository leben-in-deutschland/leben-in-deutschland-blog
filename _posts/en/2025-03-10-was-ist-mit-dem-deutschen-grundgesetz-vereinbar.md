💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German Basic Law forms the constitutional basis of the Federal Republic of Germany and protects fundamental human rights and the dignity of the individual. It determines which state measures and penalties are permissible and which are not. In particular, the Basic Law prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments. In the context of criminal justice, it is therefore examined which punitive measures are compatible with the provisions of the Basic Law.
