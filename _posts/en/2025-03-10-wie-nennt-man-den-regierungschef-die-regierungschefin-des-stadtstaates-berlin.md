    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Berlin is both a city and an independent state in Germany. The government of the city-state is led by a designated official who is responsible for administration and political direction. Different German cities and states use different titles for their heads of government, such as Prime Minister, Lord Mayor or Mayor. In Berlin, on the other hand, there is a unique designation that reflects the city's special position as a city-state. Understanding this variety of titles is important in order to determine the correct designation for the leading position in Berlin.
