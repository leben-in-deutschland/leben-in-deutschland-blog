💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After World War II, Berlin was divided into four sectors controlled by the Allies. In June 1948, the Soviet Union began the Berlin blockade by cutting off all land and water routes to West Berlin in order to force the Western powers to give up their sectors. In response, the United States, Great Britain and France organized the Berlin Airlift to supply the population with food, fuel and other essential goods by plane. This airlift lasted until May 1949 and was a decisive event in the early Cold War.
