    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Hamburg, Germany's second-largest city, is divided into several districts called Bezirke. Each Bezirk has its own unique culture and administrative role. For example, **Altona** is a prominent district in Hamburg known for its vibrant neighborhoods and maritime history. In contrast, **Hemelingen** is located in Hannover, **Pankow** is a district in Berlin, and **Mecklenburgische Seenplatte** is a region in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Understanding these distinctions helps in identifying which areas are officially part of Hamburg.
