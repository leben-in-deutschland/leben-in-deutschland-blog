    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Berlin, residents participate in Kommunalwahlen, which are local elections to choose members of the Bezirksverordnetenversammlung (district councils). These elections play a crucial role in determining local policies and governance. Voting age eligibility can vary depending on the type of election and regional regulations. While the national voting age in Germany for federal elections is typically 18, some local elections may have different age requirements. Understanding the correct voting age is important for eligible citizens to exercise their democratic rights and influence their community’s future.
