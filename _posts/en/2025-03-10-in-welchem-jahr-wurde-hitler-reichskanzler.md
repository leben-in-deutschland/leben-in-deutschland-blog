  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Adolf Hitler played a central role in German politics in the early 1930s. After the Great Depression and political instability, the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) gained increasing support. Elections in the Reichstag showed that the Nazis became the largest party, but they needed a coalition to form the government. Through political maneuvers and pressure on conservative leaders, Hitler was finally appointed Reich Chancellor on January 30, 1933. This event marked the beginning of National Socialist rule in Germany.
