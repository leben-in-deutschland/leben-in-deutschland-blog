💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Hesse is one of the 16 federal states of Germany and has a state government with various ministries. The usual positions include the Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance, and Minister of the Interior, who are responsible for the country's law, finance, and internal affairs. In contrast, there is the State Department, which is responsible for foreign affairs at the federal level. Since foreign policy does not fall within the competence of a single federal state, Hesse does not have a foreign minister.
