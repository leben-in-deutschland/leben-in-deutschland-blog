    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, citizens have the right to demonstrate peacefully and to express their opinions publicly. However, certain legal requirements must be complied with in order to ensure safety and order. Before a demonstration, the organizers must register the event with the local police department. This enables the authorities to plan appropriate measures and avoid possible conflicts. The registration includes details such as the date, time, route, and purpose of the demonstration. Without proper registration, the assembly can be restricted or banned.
