💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, certain legal obligations apply to most children. A central regulation is the **compulsory schooling**, which states that children must attend school in order to receive a basic education. This ensures that all children have access to education and that their development is encouraged. In contrast, there is no **compulsory voting**, **confidentiality** or **religious duty** that would be generally binding for children. These regulations affect either other age groups or specific occupational groups and are not part of the general children's rights and duties in Germany.
