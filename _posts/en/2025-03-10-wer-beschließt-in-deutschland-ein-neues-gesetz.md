💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, new laws are passed as part of the legislative process. The federal government can introduce draft laws, but the main responsibility lies with parliament, the Bundestag. There, the drafts are discussed, amended and voted on. After several readings and possibly mediation by the Bundesrat, the laws must be passed by both chambers. Courts interpret and apply the laws, while the police are responsible for enforcing them. Thus, the parliament is the central authority for the adoption of new laws.
