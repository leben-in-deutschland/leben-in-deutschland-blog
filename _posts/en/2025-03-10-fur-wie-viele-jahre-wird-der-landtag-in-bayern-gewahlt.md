    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The state parliament is the parliament of the Free State of Bavaria and is responsible for legislation and control of the state government. The members of the state parliament are elected at regular intervals to ensure the political representation of the citizens. The length of the legislative period determines how many years the MPs remain in office before new elections are held. This election period influences the stability of the government and the planning of political measures within the state.
