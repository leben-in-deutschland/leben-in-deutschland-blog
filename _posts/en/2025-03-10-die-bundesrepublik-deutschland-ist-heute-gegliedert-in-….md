  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Federal Republic of Germany is a federal state that is divided into different administrative levels. After the Second World War, Germany was initially divided into four occupation zones and later divided into East and West Germany. Since reunification in 1990, Germany has consisted of the federal government, the 16 federal states and the municipalities. The federal government takes on nationwide tasks, the states have their own competences in areas such as education and police, and the municipalities take care of local affairs. This federal system allows for decentralised administration and takes regional differences into account.
