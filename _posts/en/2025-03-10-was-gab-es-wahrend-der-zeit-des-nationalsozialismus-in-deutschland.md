💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    During the period of National Socialism in Germany (1933–1945), the NSDAP established totalitarian rule. Political opposition and other parties were banned, which excluded political diversity. Freedom of the press was severely restricted in order to ensure control over information. Individual rights such as the right to the free development of the personality were suppressed in favor of the state. Although the protection of human dignity was in the constitution, it was significantly violated by discriminatory laws and persecutions.
