  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is a federal parliamentary democracy in Central Europe. The political system is based on a constitution, the Basic Law, which was introduced in 1949. The Federal Republic of Germany consists of 16 federal states that have their own governments. The legislature consists of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, while the Federal Chancellor heads the executive. Germany does not have a monarchy, dictatorship or principality as a form of government. This system promotes democratic principles, the rule of law and power-sharing.
