    In Germany, fundamental rights are enshrined in the Basic Law, which protects the freedom and equality of citizens. Freedom of expression allows residents to express their views freely, while the right to petition allows citizens to address concerns directly to the government. Freedom of assembly guarantees the right to peaceful assembly and exchange views. In addition, German laws prohibit any form of unequal treatment by the state in order to ensure equality and fairness for all citizens. These rights form the foundation of German democracy and the rule of law.
