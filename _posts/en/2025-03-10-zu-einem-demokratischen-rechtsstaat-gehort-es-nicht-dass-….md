  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    A democratic state based on the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights. Citizens have the right to express criticism of the government and to demonstrate peacefully. State institutions must be transparent and accountable. Arbitrary measures, such as arrest by a private police force without reasonable suspicion, are inadmissible. Only in the case of actual crimes may people be lawfully arrested. This understanding helps to identify which characteristics do not belong to a democratic state governed by the rule of law.
