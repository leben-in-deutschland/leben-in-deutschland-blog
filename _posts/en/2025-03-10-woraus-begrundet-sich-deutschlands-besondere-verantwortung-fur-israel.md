💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War and the National Socialist crimes against the Jews, Germany recognizes a special responsibility towards the State of Israel. This responsibility manifests itself in political, diplomatic and social relations aimed at keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive and supporting Israel's security. In addition, historical obligations are enshrined in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, which emphasise dealing with the past and promoting peace and human rights. These aspects form the background to the question of Germany's special responsibility towards Israel.
