    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Specific voting rules apply to Bundestag and state elections in Germany:

- Postal voting: Voters can cast their vote by mail, which is a convenient option for many.
- **Voting age**: The right to vote is generally held by citizens aged 18 and over; younger people are not allowed to vote.
- **Voting on election day**: The vote must be cast in person at the polling stations; telephone voting is not permitted.
- **Electoral representation**: Every voter must vote himself; it is not permissible for someone else, such as a husband, to vote for you.

These regulations ensure fair and transparent elections in Germany.
