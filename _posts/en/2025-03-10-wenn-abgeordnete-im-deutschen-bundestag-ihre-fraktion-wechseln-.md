  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the German Bundestag, members of parliament form parliamentary groups, which usually correspond to the political parties. These factions play a central role in forming a government and determining majorities in parliament. If a member of parliament changes his parliamentary group, this can change the balance of power and possibly jeopardize the majority of the government. In addition, there are certain rules and procedures that regulate a change of parliamentary group, such as the approval of the Federal President. A change can also influence the relationship with voters, as they are often tied to the original party.
