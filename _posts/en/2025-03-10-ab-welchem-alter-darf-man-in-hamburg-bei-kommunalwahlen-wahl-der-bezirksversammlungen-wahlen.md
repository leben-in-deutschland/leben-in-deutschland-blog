  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Hamburg, municipal elections determine the composition of the district assemblies that make important decisions for the local districts. The right to vote, i.e. the right to vote, is tied to certain age requirements. These regulations are intended to ensure that eligible voters are sufficiently mature to make informed decisions. Different federal states can set different age limits for local elections. In Hamburg, it is important to know from what age citizens are allowed to exercise their right to vote at the district assemblies.
