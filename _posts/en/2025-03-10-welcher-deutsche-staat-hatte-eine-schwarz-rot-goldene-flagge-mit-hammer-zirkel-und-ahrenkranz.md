  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The question refers to the flags of German states and their specific symbols. The **Prussians** mainly used white and red colors without complex emblems. The **Federal Republic of Germany** uses the black-red-gold tricolor without additional symbols. The "Third Reich" also used the black-red-gold flag, but with a swastika. The **GDR**, on the other hand, used the black-red-gold flag with the emblem of hammer and compass to symbolize workers and intellectuals, as well as a wreath of wheat representing agriculture. This emblem distinguished the GDR from other German states.
