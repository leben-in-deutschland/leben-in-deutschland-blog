💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, taxpayers receive a tax assessment notice from the tax office that shows the tax liability assessed. If this decision is incorrect, the persons concerned have the right to take action against it. To do this, they must formally file an objection within a certain period of time, usually one month after receipt of the decision. The objection will check the decision and correct it if necessary. Options such as doing nothing or throwing away the notice are not expedient and leave the notice in place.
