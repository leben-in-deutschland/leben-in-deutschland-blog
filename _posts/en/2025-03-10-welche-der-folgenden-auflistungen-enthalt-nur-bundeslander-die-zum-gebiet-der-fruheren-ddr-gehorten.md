    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The GDR mainly comprised the present-day federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These regions formed the territory of the former East Germany. In contrast, federal states such as Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia or Hesse belonged to the FRG. Knowledge of this historical division helps to determine which list contains only federal states of the former GDR.
