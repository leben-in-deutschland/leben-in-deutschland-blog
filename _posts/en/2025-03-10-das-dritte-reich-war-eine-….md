    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "Third Reich" refers to German history from 1933 to 1945 under the leadership of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and Adolf Hitler. During this time, a totalitarian government was established that suppressed political opponents, restricted freedom of expression and pursued an aggressive expansionist policy. The regime was characterized by propaganda, militarism and the attempt to build an "Aryan" society. This phase followed the German Empire ("First Reich") and the Weimar Republic ("Second Reich") and ended with the end of the Second World War.
