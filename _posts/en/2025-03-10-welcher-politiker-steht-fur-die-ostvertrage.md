    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The "Eastern Treaties" were a series of agreements in the 1970s that aimed to improve relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Eastern European states. This policy, known as the New Ostpolitik, was implemented under the leadership of the German Chancellor and promoted détente during the Cold War. The aim was to reduce political tensions, strengthen trade and intensify dialogue with countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland and the GDR. The Eastern Treaties played a central role in German foreign policy at the time.
