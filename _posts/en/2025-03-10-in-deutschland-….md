  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, marriage is legally defined as a union between two people. German law only allows monogamous marriage, which means that a person may only be married to one partner at the same time. Polygamous marriages, i.e. marriages with several people at the same time, are not recognized by law. After a divorce or the death of a spouse, there is the possibility of remarrying. There are no gender-specific restrictions on remarriage.
