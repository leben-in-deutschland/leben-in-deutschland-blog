  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German Bundesrat is a central body in the German political system that represents the interests of the 16 federal states at the federal level. It participates in legislation and must approve many laws before they can come into force. The members of the Bundesrat are not directly elected members of parliament, but representatives of the respective state governments. The Federal Council ensures that regional perspectives and needs are taken into account in national policy. Understanding who makes up the Bundesrat is essential for understanding Germany's federal structure.
