  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the decision as to whether a child attends kindergarten is the responsibility of several actors. The education system is organised on a federal basis, which means that the federal states can set their own regulations. At the same time, parents or guardians have the right to determine the care of their child. The state provides the framework conditions and financial support, while schools usually have no direct influence on kindergarten attendance. This combination of state requirements and parental decision ultimately determines a child's kindergarten attendance.
