💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the separation of powers is based on three state powers to safeguard democracy and the rule of law. The **Legislative** is responsible for legislation and consists mainly of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The **executive** includes the government and administration that implement and enforce laws. The **judiciary** is the judicial power, represented by independent courts. These three powers control each other to prevent abuse of power. Terms such as **directive** do not belong to the state authorities, but refer to instructions or guidelines.
