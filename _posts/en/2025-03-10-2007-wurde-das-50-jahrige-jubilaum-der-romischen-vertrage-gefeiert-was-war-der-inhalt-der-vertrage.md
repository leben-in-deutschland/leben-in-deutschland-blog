    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Treaties of Rome were signed on 25 March 1957 by six European countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. These treaties led to the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The aim was economic integration, the dismantling of trade barriers and the promotion of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The treaties laid the foundation for today's European Union and strengthened cooperation between member states after the Second World War. In 2007, its 50th anniversary was celebrated.
