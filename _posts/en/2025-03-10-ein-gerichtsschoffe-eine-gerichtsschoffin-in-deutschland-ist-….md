    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the court lay judge plays an important role in the legal system. Court lay judges are honorary judges who participate in criminal and civil proceedings together with professional judges. They bring the citizens' point of view into the decision-making process and contribute to balanced jurisprudence. Court jurors are not law students, but are selected from the population to bring a variety of perspectives to the court. Their work is voluntary and serves democratic participation in the judiciary.
