  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Basic Law protects freedom of the press as an essential fundamental right that guarantees the free formation of opinion and the dissemination of information. The German Bundestag, the national parliament, can change laws, but fundamental rights are particularly protected and usually require a qualified majority for amendments. Parties in the Bundestag regularly discuss a wide range of topics, including media laws. This question examines whether a parliamentary majority is sufficient to abolish freedom of the press, taking into account the constitutional provisions and the role of other institutions such as the Federal Council.
