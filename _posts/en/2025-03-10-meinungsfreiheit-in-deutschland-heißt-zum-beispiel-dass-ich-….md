  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Freedom of expression is enshrined in the Basic Law in Germany and guarantees every citizen the right to freely express and disseminate his or her thoughts and opinions. This includes both oral and written statements, including on the Internet. However, there are legal restrictions to ensure the protection of personal honour, public safety and constitutional order. For example, the public display of unconstitutional symbols such as Nazi symbols is prohibited. Hate speech and calls for violence are also punishable. Freedom of expression therefore applies within this legal framework.
