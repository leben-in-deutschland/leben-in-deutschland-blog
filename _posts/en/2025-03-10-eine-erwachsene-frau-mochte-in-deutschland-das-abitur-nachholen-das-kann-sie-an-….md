    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Abitur is the general higher education entrance qualification in Germany that allows access to universities. Adults who want to catch up on their Abitur have flexible educational opportunities available. A common option is to attend an evening grammar school, which is specially designed for working people and adults. These institutions offer evening class times to balance learning and work. In contrast, colleges and universities are primarily intended for those who have already graduated from high school or are university students, while lower secondary schools serve a different educational purpose.
