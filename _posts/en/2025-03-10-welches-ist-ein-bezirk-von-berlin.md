    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Berlin is the capital of Germany and is divided into twelve districts (districts), each of which has its own administrations and characteristic districts. One of these districts is Pankow, known for its lively cultural scene and diverse residential areas. The other options such as Altona, Prignitz, and Mecklenburg Lake District belong to different regions or states of Germany and are not Berlin districts. Understanding the administrative structure of Berlin helps to better classify the geographical and political structure of the city.
