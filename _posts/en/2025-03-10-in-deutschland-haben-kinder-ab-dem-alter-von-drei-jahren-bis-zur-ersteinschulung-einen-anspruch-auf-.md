  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, children from the age of three to their first school enrolment have access to various state-supported services. This age is crucial for early childhood education and social development. Parents can enroll their children in kindergartens or daycare centers that offer educational care and learning opportunities. These facilities not only promote cognitive development, but also social skills and motor skills. Eligibility for a kindergarten place ensures that all children, regardless of their background, receive quality early childhood education before entering the formal school system.
