    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The phrase "We are the people" became a symbol of the desire for freedom and change in the GDR. It played a central role in the Monday demonstrations in the fall of 1989, in which thousands of people in East Germany peacefully protested for democratic reforms and an end to SED rule. These demonstrations eventually led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. In contrast, other historical protests, such as the 1953 workers' uprising or the demonstrations in the 1960s and 1980s, have been shaped by different slogans and goals.
