💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  a
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, the Senate forms the state government and consists of several senators who head different departments. Typical departments include finance, justice and home affairs, which are central tasks of the city administration. However, there is not a separate senator for all possible departments. In particular, the department for external relations does not exist in Bremen's senatorial structure, as foreign affairs are often regulated at the federal level or by other institutions.
