  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Certain legal requirements must be met for a divorce in Germany. In principle, a one-year separation period is required before the divorce can be filed. During the process, the support of a lawyer is often necessary in order to accompany the legal steps correctly. The consent of the parents or children and a medical certificate are usually not required. These requirements ensure that the divorce is carried out properly and in compliance with the legal provisions.
