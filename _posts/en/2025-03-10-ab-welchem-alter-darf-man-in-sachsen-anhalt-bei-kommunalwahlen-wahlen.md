💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the voting age varies depending on the type of election and the federal state. While universal suffrage applies to Bundestag elections from the age of 18, some federal states have lowered the voting age for local elections. Saxony-Anhalt is one of these federal states that allows younger citizens to participate in local elections. This amendment aims to promote the political participation of young people and to strengthen democratic awareness at an early stage. Therefore, the question arises as to the age at which residents in Saxony-Anhalt are allowed to cast their votes in local elections.
