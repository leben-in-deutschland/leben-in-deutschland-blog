  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the voting age varies depending on the type of election and the federal state. In local elections that affect decisions at the local level, the federal states determine the age at which citizens are allowed to participate. In Saarland, the voting age for local elections may have been adjusted to allow younger citizens to have a say. This regulation reflects the trend to promote political engagement at a younger age.
