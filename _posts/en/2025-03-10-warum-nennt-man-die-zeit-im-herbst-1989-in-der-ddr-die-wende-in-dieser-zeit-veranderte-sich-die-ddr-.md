    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In the autumn of 1989, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was in a phase of profound political change. The growing pressure of the population for freedom and reforms led to massive demonstrations and the fall of the Berlin Wall. These events marked the end of the authoritarian regime and the transition to democratic structures. This decisive turning point is referred to as "The Turn" and symbolizes the change from a dictatorship to democracy in the GDR.
