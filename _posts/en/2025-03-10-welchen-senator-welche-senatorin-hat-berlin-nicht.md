💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  c
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    There are several senators in the Berlin state government, each of whom is responsible for different departments, such as finance, interior and justice. These senators form the Senate of Berlin, which heads the administration of the capital. However, foreign policy is mainly handled by the federal level in Germany, which is why Berlin typically does not have its own senator for foreign relations. This question tests the understanding of the specific distribution of tasks within the Berlin Senate.
