  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Lower Saxony, a federal state of Germany, has various ministries that are responsible for administration. Typical ministries include Justice, Finance, and Home Affairs, which perform important functions within the country. However, foreign affairs fall under the responsibility of the Federal Government, which is why Lower Saxony does not have its own Foreign Ministry. This structure reflects the federal organization of Germany, in which certain tasks are regulated at the federal level and others at the state level.
