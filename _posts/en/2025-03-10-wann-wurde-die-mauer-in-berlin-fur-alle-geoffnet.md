💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin and prevent escape from the GDR. In the late 1980s, political changes in Eastern Europe and increasing pressure from the population led to increased protests. On November 9, 1989, the GDR government surprisingly announced the opening of the Wall. This allowed citizens to travel freely between the two parts of Berlin and marked the beginning of the end of the division of Germany.

**Answer:** b: 1989
