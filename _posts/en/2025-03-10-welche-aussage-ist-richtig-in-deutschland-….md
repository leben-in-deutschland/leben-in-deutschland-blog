💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  a
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, there is a clear relationship between the state and religious communities. The Basic Law guarantees freedom of religion and separates state institutions from religious organizations. While the state remains neutral and does not favor any religion, it nevertheless cooperates with churches in areas such as education and social welfare. In addition, religious communities levy church taxes, which are collected by the state. This separation is intended to ensure the freedom of all citizens and to ensure that state decisions are not influenced by religious institutions.
