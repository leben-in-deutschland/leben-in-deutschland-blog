    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The Berlin State Parliament, known as the House of Representatives, is the legislative power of the capital. The members of parliament are regularly elected to help shape Berlin's political direction and make important decisions for the city. The electoral period determines how long these elected representatives remain in office before new elections are called. A fixed term of office ensures stability and enables effective planning and implementation of political measures.
