    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Germany is a federal republic divided into federal states. Each state has its own governments and responsibilities, especially in areas such as education, police and culture. After reunification in 1990, the Federal Republic of Germany comprises both the West German and the new federal states from the former East. Overall, the number of federal states plays an important role in the political structure and administration of the state. This structure promotes regional diversity and enables decentralised decision-making.
