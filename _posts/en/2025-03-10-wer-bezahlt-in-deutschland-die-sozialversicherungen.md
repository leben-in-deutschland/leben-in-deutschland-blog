  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the social security system is based on a joint financing system between employers and employees. Social insurance includes pension, health, long-term care, unemployment and accident insurance. Both parties pay a certain percentage of the gross salary into these insurances. This system ensures that employees are covered in the event of illness, unemployment or old age, while employers protect their employees through accident insurance contributions. The legal regulation determines exactly who bears which shares.
