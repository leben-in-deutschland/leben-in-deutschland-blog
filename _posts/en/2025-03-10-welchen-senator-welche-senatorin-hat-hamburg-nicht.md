  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Hamburg, as one of Germany’s 16 federal states, is governed by a Senate composed of various senators responsible for different portfolios. Common senatorial roles include Justizsenator/in (Justice), Finanzsenator/in (Finance), and Innensenator/in (Interior). These senators manage their respective departments, shaping policies and administration within the city-state. Understanding the specific departments helps determine which roles exist in Hamburg’s government structure. Not all states have identical portfolios; some positions present in other regions might be absent in Hamburg, reflecting its unique administrative organization.
