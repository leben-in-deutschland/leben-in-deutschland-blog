  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, federal legislation consists of several institutions. The federal states, i.e. the individual states, have influence on federal laws through the Bundesrat. The Bundesrat acts as the representative of the Länder and examines and votes on draft laws introduced by the Bundestag. In this way, the federal states ensure that their interests are taken into account in the federal legislative process. Other institutions such as the Federal Assembly or the Federal Government have different roles in the political system.
