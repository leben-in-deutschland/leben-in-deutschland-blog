💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Federal Government consists of the Federal Chancellor and the Federal Ministers. The Federal Chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and determines the guidelines of politics. The Federal Ministers are proposed by the Federal Chancellor and officially appointed by the Federal President. The Federal President thus has the formal task of appointing the ministers and putting the government in office. Other positions, such as the President of the Federal Constitutional Court, the President of the Bundesrat or the President of the Bundestag, have no authority to appoint federal ministers.
