  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the end of the Second World War, Germany was occupied by the victorious powers USA, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union. Berlin in particular, although located deep within the Soviet occupation zone, was also divided into four sectors. This division led to the division of the city into East and West Berlin and played a central role in the Cold War. The sectors served as administrative units for the Allies and were a symbol of the geopolitical tensions of the time. This historic division of Berlin is an important event in German post-war history.
