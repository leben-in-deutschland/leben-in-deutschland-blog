    A couple is planning to open their own restaurant in Germany. To do this, they have to take various legal and administrative steps. This includes the selection of a suitable location, the registration of the business and compliance with hygiene and safety regulations. Obtaining the necessary permits from the responsible authorities is particularly important. No food and drinks may be offered for consumption without the correct permission.
