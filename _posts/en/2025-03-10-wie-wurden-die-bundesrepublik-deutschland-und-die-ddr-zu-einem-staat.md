  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and the political changes that followed, German reunification took place. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) began negotiations to merge their two states into a united Germany. On 3 October 1990, the five eastern federal states of the former GDR officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany. This process led to the formation of a single German state, with Western structures and institutions being adopted. This historic unification marks the end of the division of Germany after the Second World War.
