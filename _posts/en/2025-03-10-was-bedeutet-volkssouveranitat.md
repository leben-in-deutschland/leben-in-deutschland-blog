  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    **Context:**
Popular sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the democratic state order. It states that all state power emanates from the people and not from a single person or institution. In a sovereign democracy, the people exert direct or indirect influence on the government through elections and votes. This principle is in contrast to monarchical or authoritarian systems, in which power is concentrated. Popular sovereignty ensures that political decisions reflect the interests and will of the citizens.
