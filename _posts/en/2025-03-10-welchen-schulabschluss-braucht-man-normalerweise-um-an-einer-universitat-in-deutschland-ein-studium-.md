  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the educational path is clearly structured to regulate access to universities. The most important school-leaving certificate for studying at a university is the Abitur, which is awarded after successful completion of the upper secondary school. This certificate qualifies students to take up university studies in most disciplines. Other degrees, such as a diploma, are specialized degrees obtained after a university degree. Job-related qualifications such as the power of attorney or the journeyman's examination, on the other hand, are relevant for certain professional careers and are not necessary for university studies.
