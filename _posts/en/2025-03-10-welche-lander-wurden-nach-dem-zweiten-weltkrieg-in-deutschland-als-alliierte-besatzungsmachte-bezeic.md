  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany was divided into four occupation zones by the victorious powers. The "Allied Occupying Powers" were the United States (USA), the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. Each of these powers took control of a certain part of Germany, which led to the later division into West and East Germany. This occupation lasted until the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in 1949. The understanding of this division is essential for the history of the post-war period and the political development of Germany.
