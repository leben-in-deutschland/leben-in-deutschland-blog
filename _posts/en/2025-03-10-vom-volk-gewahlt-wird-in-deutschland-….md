  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the political system is based on democratic principles, in which various offices are elected directly or indirectly by the people. The Bundestag, as a national parliament, is directly elected by the citizens and plays a central role in legislation. The Federal President is also elected by the Federal Assembly, which consists of members of the Bundestag and representatives of the Länder. The Federal Chancellor, on the other hand, is determined by the Bundestag, based on the majority. Minister-presidents of the federal states are elected directly by the members of the state parliament. This system ensures representative democracy at different levels of government.
