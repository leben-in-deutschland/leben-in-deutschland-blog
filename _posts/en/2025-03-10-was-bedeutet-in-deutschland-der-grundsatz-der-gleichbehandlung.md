    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the principle of equal treatment is a central principle in the legal system, which aims to prevent discrimination in all areas of life. It is anchored in laws such as the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) and protects people from discrimination based on characteristics such as disability, gender, origin, religion or age. This principle promotes equal opportunities and ensures that all persons are treated fairly and equitably, whether in working life, education or access to services.
