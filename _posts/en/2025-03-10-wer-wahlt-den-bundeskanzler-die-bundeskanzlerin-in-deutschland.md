  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Federal Chancellor is the head of government. After a Bundestag election, the members of the Bundestag propose the Chancellor. This proposal must then be confirmed by the Bundestag with a majority of its members. The Bundesrat, the Federal Assembly and the people have no direct electoral authority for the office of Federal Chancellor. This process ensures that the chancellor has the support of the majority in parliament.
