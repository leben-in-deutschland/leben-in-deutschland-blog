💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    North Rhine-Westphalia is the most populous state in Germany and has its own state government. This consists of various ministers who head different departments, such as justice, finance and home affairs. The state ministers are responsible for regional affairs and the implementation of laws at the state level. However, there are certain ministerial posts that exist exclusively at the federal level, such as the foreign minister, who is responsible for Germany's foreign policy. Therefore, North Rhine-Westphalia is not equipped with all nationwide ministerial offices.
