  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany was divided into four occupation zones by the Allies. The main occupying powers were the United States, the Soviet Union, France and the United Kingdom. These countries oversaw the demilitarization, denazification, and reconstruction of Germany. Japan, on the other hand, was part of the Axis powers and was mainly occupied by the USA after the war, but not in Germany. Therefore, Japan was not an "Allied occupying power" in Germany.
