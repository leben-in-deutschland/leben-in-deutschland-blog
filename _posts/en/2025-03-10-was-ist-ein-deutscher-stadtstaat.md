  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    A German city-state is a city that also forms an independent federal state within Germany. These city-states have their own state government and manage their own affairs such as education, police, and administration. There are currently three city-states in Germany: Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen. These cities enjoy a special status because they perform both urban and state functions. Other large cities such as Munich, Frankfurt and Erfurt are important, but not independent federal states, but belong to the federal states of Bavaria, Hesse and Thuringia.
