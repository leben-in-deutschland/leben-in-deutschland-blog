💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  d
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Basic Law and democratic principles secure the free democratic basic order. Political parties must commit to these values. Parties that aim to establish a dictatorship contradict constitutional principles. The Federal Constitutional Court can classify such parties as unconstitutional and ban them. This ensures the protection of democracy and prevents the concentration of power in undemocratic structures.

**Correct answer:**  
D: Unconstitutional.
