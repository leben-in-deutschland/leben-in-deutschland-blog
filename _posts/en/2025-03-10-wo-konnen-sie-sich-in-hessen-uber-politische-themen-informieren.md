  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Hesse, citizens have various opportunities to inform themselves about political topics. The **State Agency for Civic Education** offers extensive materials, events and educational offers that promote political understanding. In contrast, the **Consumer Advice Centre** focuses on consumer rights, the **Public Order Office** takes on tasks responsible for public order and security, and **churches** are socially engaged, but are not a primary source of political education. Therefore, the State Agency for Civic Education is the appropriate point of contact for information on political topics in Hesse.
