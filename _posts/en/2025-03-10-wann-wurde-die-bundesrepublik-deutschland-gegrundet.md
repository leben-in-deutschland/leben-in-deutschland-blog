  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    After the Second World War, Germany was divided into occupation zones by the Allies. During this time, the western zones strove for a political and economic reorganization. In 1949, the Western occupying powers led to the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) as a democratic state in the western parts of Germany. This foundation marked the beginning of the division of Germany into East and West during the Cold War and laid the foundation for later reunification in 1990.
