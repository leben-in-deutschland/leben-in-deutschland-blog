    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German national anthem, known as "Das Lied der Deutschen" or "Deutschlandlied", was first introduced in 1922. After the Second World War, only the third verse is officially used as the national anthem. This begins with the words "Unity and Justice and Freedom" and symbolizes the fundamental values of Germany. Knowing the opening lines is important for understanding the national identity and the historical development of the country.
