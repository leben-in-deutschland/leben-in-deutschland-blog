  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the age limits for the right to vote vary depending on the type of election and the federal state. In the elections to the Bürgerschaft, the state parliament of Bremen, citizens must have reached a certain minimum age to be allowed to vote. This age limit is intended to ensure that voters are sufficiently mature and informed to participate in political decisions. The question examines the specific minimum age for eligibility to vote in Bremen, with options ranging from 14 to 20 years.
