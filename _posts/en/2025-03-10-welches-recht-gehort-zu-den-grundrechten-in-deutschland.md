    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the Basic Law protects fundamental rights that secure the freedom and dignity of citizens. These fundamental rights include, among other things, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and the protection of personal development. They form the basis of the German legal system and ensure that state power does not intervene arbitrarily. These rights are essential for a democratic society and serve to protect individual freedoms and promote social coexistence.
