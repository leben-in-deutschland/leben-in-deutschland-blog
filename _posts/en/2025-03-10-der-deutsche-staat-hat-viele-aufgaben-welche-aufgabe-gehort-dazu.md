  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    The German state has the responsibility to shape public life and provide basic infrastructure. This includes the construction and maintenance of roads and schools to ensure education and mobility for all citizens. The state also promotes social services, security and public facilities. In contrast, the sale of food and clothing, as well as the production of cars and buses, are the responsibility of private companies, not government agencies. Understanding these responsibilities helps identify the correct answer to the question.
