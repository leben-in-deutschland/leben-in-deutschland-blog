💡  <b>Correct Answer:</b>  b
  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    Saarland is one of Germany's 16 federal states and has various state ministries that cover different areas of government. Typical ministries include Justice, Finance and Home Affairs, each headed by a minister. These ministries are responsible for the administration and domestic affairs of the Saarland. However, foreign policy tasks and international relations fall within the area of responsibility of the Federal Government, which is why Saarland does not have its own Foreign Ministry and thus no Foreign Minister.
