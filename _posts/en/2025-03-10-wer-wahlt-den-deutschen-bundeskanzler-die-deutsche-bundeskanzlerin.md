  </p>
  <p>
    📖<b>Explanation:</b>
    In Germany, the election of the Federal Chancellor plays a central role in the political system. After a Bundestag election, the members of the German Bundestag elect the Chancellor. The Bundestag is the main organ of the legislature and consists of directly elected representatives. The Federal Convention, on the other hand, only meets in the event of a chancellor election outside the regular electoral period and consists of members of the Bundestag and representatives of the federal states. The people elect the Bundestag directly, but not the Federal Chancellor. The Federal Government, consisting of the Chancellor and the Ministers, is led by the Chancellor.
